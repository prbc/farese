Greatest Concern in the World:</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The jailer "brought them out, and
said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house" (Acts 16:30-31)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It is impossible to ask a more weighty
Question! It is deplorable that we hear it asked with no more Frequency,
with nor more Agony. The Spirit of Slumber which the Poison of the old
Serpent has brought upon the children of Men is to be deplored exceedingly.
Awaken us out of this [terrible] stupidity, O God of all Grace, lest we
perish [eternally].&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>My Design is to bring in a Good and
full Answer to this Weighty Question, Oh! how Thankful ought we to be,
for the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God, that makes us able to Answer
it! The Gospel which we have in our hands, this a Gospel of such astonishing
Mystery, of such Heavenly Majesty, and of such Consummate Purity, that
it can be no other than the Word of God; It must be of a Divine Original.
Oh! highly Favoured People, who know this Joyful Sound! Oh! Unavoidably
and Inexcusably Wretched, if we disregard it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Devils knew, That those Excellent
Ministers of the Lord Paul and Silas, were come to Philippi, with a design
to answer this Weighty Question. They could not bear it; they feared it
would issue in a Destruction upon their Kingdom there. They stirred up
the minds of some Wicked People, to abuse and Revile these Ministers, and
run them into Prison. Some Wicked People were afraid lest they should lose
a little Money, by the coming of such Ministers among them; and the Devils
inspired these Muckworms to use incessant Endeavours until they had made
these Ministers uncapable of Preaching any more unto them.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Our Glorious Lord appeared for his
Faithful Servants. They Glorified Him in the midst of their Trials. They
Sang His Praises under the Stripes and the Stocks which the Satanic Party
inflicted on them. Oh, Patient Servants of the Lord! What a symptom have
you that you shall one Day Reign in Glory with Him? These poor men Sang
unto the Lord; the Lord heard them, and sav'd them! A terrible Earthquake
at Midnight shook open the Doors of their Prison. The Keeper that had the
now superseded keys of the Prison, was terrified. In his consternation,
he falls down at the feet of his Prisoners, he treats them no longer as
Prisoners, but rather as Angels. He fervently puts to them the Question,
which, Oh! That it were often heard with an equal fervency among us! What
must I do to be Saved?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Some Learned men think that the Goaler
had from the Traditions of their Philosophers, conceived some Hope of a
better Life; and seeing his Life here in danger, he does, as distressed
Wretches in the Last minutes of their Life use to do, Cry out for some
help to make sure of a Better Life, Or, more probably, the late words of
the possessed Young Woman in the Town about these Ministers; These men
are the Servants of the most High God, who show unto us the way of Salvation;
might run in his mind, and mind him of that Salvation, and make him think,
whether these men were not appointed of God, for the Instruction of others
in the way to that Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>There is a most important matter
which must now be undertaken to be demonstrated. That whereas there must
be something done, by every man that would be saved, it should be the Sollicitious
Inquiry of every man What must be done by him, that he may be Saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We will proceed upon the awakening
Demonstrations of this thing; Demonstrations more powerful than any Thunderbolts.
Oh! that the issue might be, that the Hearers may be Awakened, with a mighty
Impression upon their Souls to make the Enquiry What must I do to be Saved?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>I. You must know, that There is a
Great Salvation proposed unto the sinful Children of men; And you must
Know, and Think, That there is Nothing of So Great Concernment for any
man, as to obtain a part in that Great Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Indeed Knowledge is the first Thing,
that is necessary in order to Salvation; And it is absolutely necessary,
Unspeakable Necessary. [Prov. 1] We read Hosea 4:6. of People Destroyed
for the lack of Knowledge.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Ah! destructive Ignorance, what shall
be done to chase thee out of the World! A world which by thee is rendered
a dark World, the Kingdom of Darkness! The Oracles of Wisdom have assured
us The Soul without knowledge is not good; They assured us,&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>They who know not God shall have
a Vengeance in flaming Fire, taken of them; They have assured us; 'Tis
Life Eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath
sent. An Ignorance of the [true] Gospel, is attended with a long Train
of Unknown, but very Evil Consequences. Tis the Gospel of Salvation; They
that are Ignorant of it must needs miss of Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>'Tis an Erroneous and Pernicious
Principle, That a Man may be Saved in any Religion, if he do but Live according
to it. The unerring and infallible Gospel has expressly taught us otherwise
[in] 2 Cor. 4:3 "If our gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that be lost."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It is not unseasonable here, and
as Early as may be, to bring in that Admonition.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Knowledge, Knowledge; To get good
Knowledge, let that be the First Care of them that would be Saved. Knowledge,
'Tis a Principal thing; My Child, Get Knowledge; with all thy might, Get
understanding. Oh! That this Resolution might immediately be made in the
minds of all our people; I will get as much Knowledge as ever I can!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Word of God must be Read and
Heard with Diligence that so you may arrive to the Knowledge that is needful
for you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Catechisms in which you have
the Word of God fitted for your more early Apprehension of it must be diligently
Studied.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Unto all the other Means of Knowledge,
there must be added, Humble and Earnest Supplications before the Glorious
Lord, You must cry to God for Knowledge, and lift up your Voice to Him
for Understanding; Prefer it before Silver, Before any Earthy Treasures.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>There may be some so very Ignorant,
that they know not how to Pray. I would advise them to take the Hundred
and Nineteenth Psalm. They will find in it many a Prayer suited unto their
circumstances, Take it, Use it, and particularly those Petitions in it:
Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes; and Lord, Teach me Good Judgment
and Knowledge; and Lord, Give me Understanding, that I may know thy Testimonies:
Give me understanding and I shall Live. Take Encouragement from that word;
and Plead it before the Lord: James 1:5. If any of you lack of Wisdom,
let him ask of God that giveth to all men Liberally, and upbraideth not;
and it shall be given him.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And now to pursue diverse Ends at
once, I am to tell you That the Main Things which 'tis necessary for you
to know, are the things which concern Salvation. More Particularly;&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must know, first; From What you
do need Salvation. And here, First; You are to know, That the One Eternal
and Infinite God who Subsisteth in Three Persons which His Word call, The
Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit Created our First Parents, in an
Holy and Happy State, at the End of the Six Days, in which He Created all
things.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But, our First Parents hearkening
to the Temptations of Wicked Spirits, did Eat a Forbidden Fruit; and by
that sin, they fell from God, and from their Holy and Happy State;&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And their Fall has bro't their Children
with them, into a State of Sin and Misery, their Sin was our Sin, from
their corrupt nature we are born into the world envenom'd with such a Nature
[heart].&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Death [eternal] which the Broken
Law of God threatened unto them; is due to us all: A Death which intends
all Misery, not only in this World, but in Another, where our Souls continue
Immortal [live forever], after they have left this world.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Then you are to know; That there
is a Law given to us, which, is the Everlasting Rule, according to which
God requires us to glorify Him; a Law of Love to God and Man, contained
in our Ten Commandments.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But, that you daily break this Law;
and that every Breach of it Incurs the Wrath of God who is of Purer Eyes
than to behold Evil and cannot look upon Iniquity.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Lastly, you are to know, That while
you lie under the Guilt of Sin, you are also under the Reign of Sin, and
under the Reign of Satan too; A most woeful Oppression from the Worst Enemies
That Can Be. God is in Ill Terms with you. He visits you not with His great
consolations All Things are against you; The things that appear for your
Welfare, do but Ensnare you, do but Poison you, do but produce your further
Distance from God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your very prosperity hurts you; Your
Adversary lays the Chains of Death upon you. You are every moment in danger,
of being seized by the formidable Justice of God for Eternal Burnings.
If you Die Unpardoned, you are sent among Devils. Damn'd unto torments;
must undergo a strange Punishment, and a long one which is Reserved in
a Future State, for the workers of iniquity [unrepentent sinners].&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh! Sinner; this, is thy Lamentable
Case And Knowing this how canst thou do any other than make that Sollicitious
Enquiry; What must I do to be Saved? Knowing this Terror of the Lord. Oh!
Be Perswaded!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must know secondly by Whom you
may have Salvation. And here; You are to know the great mystery of godliness
God manifests in flesh. Your Salvation depends on your knowing of such
a Saviour.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We have not the least Intimation
in the Book of God, That a unknown Saviour will be ours. But it is dreadfully
intimated, That if People have no Understanding of Him, He that made them
will not have mercy on them and He that formed them will shew them no Favour.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You are then to know; That the Son
of God assumed the Blessed Jesus, the Sinless and Holy Son of a Virgin,
into one person with Himself.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And this Admirable Person, who is
God and Man in one Person, has as our Surety, fulfilled the Law of God
for us; answered the precept of it, in his Righteous Life; answered the
Penalty of it, in His grievious death; suffered the Cross, and Endured
the Curse in our stead.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You are to know herewithal; that
this mighty and matchless and Only Saviour of the world, who is also the
Govenor of the World, is Risen from the Dead, and is Enthroned in the Heavens,
and will return to rule and Judge the World; but He will Save unto the
utermost All that come unto God by Him.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh! Undone Sinner; canst thou hear
of such a Saviour and not make that Sollicitious enquiry, What must I do,
that I may have an Interest in the Only Saviour?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must Know, Thirdly; What shall
be done for you if you find Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And here; You are to know that no
good thing shall be withheld from the Saved of the Lord. Wonder wonder.
Be swallowed up with wonderment, at this Grace, O self destroyed ones!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>There is Proposed unto You A deliverance
from all the undesirable Circumstances, into which you have Run, by your
Departure from God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It is proposed unto you, That you
shall No longer be the children of Death, but be made the Children of God.
That you shall be Forgiven and Accepted with a Reconciled God and be followed
with perpetual Testimonies of his Fatherly Love: That No Iniquity shall
have Dominion over you, but you shall become the amiable Temples, wherein
He will dwell, with the sweet Influences of His Good Spirit forever irradiating
of you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It is propos'd unto you; That your
Spirits, at your Dissolution [death] shall put on the Garments of Light,
and Enter into the Peace a Rest of an Heavenly Paradise: That your Bodies
ere long by a Resurrection shall be Restored unto your Spirits: but be
the Lively, the Lovely, the most Agreeable and Everlasting Mansions for
them: That you shall have a Joyful Portion in the city of God, and have
His marvelous kindness Forever doing unutterable things for you, in that
strong city: There you shall at length be filled with all the Fulness of
God and have God become All in All unto you for ever and ever.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>All this is contained in the Salvation
whereof You have a Tender. Salvation, 'Tis a comprehensive Word as Incomprehensible
Good! Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard, no Heart can conceive, what
is laid up in the Salvation of God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh! Ruin'd Sinner; why does it not
now become thy Sollicitous Enquiry; What must I do that I may not lose
the vast things whereunto I am invited by my Saviour?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>These are the things that must be
known. And if these Things Be known, and Own'd, the plain Inference from
them will be this; That the Man is forsaken of Reason, Unworthy to be called
a Reasonable Man, who is not very solicitously Inquisitive; What must I
do to be saved?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But now, 'tis time to answer that
great Enquiry, we will do it by calling in a Second Proposition.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>II. Something must be done by every
man that would not forfeit all claim, Reject all Hope of the Great Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And this also must be known. You
must Know What must be done. And thereupon it shall be said unto you; Job
13:17. "When you know these things happy are you If you do them." It is
Not Enough to Know; There must be Practice Joyn'd With your knowledge.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Something must be done; Else it had
never been said, Hebrews 5:6 "Christ is the Author of eternal Salvation,
unto all them that Obey him", Something must be done; Else we had never
been told; Hebrews 6:9 "There are the things that accompany Salvation."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We are often instructed in the Sacred
Writings, That there Is a Way, wherein alone Salvation is to be Expected,
A way called The way of Life; and, The way of truth; The way of the Lord;
and the way of Peace; and The way of Good men; and, The way of the Righteous.
In this way, Something must be done, There are Steps to be taken that we
may Fnd this way, and Keep this way. Tis the Everlasting way; There is
no Altering of it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Something must be done; For we are
sure, All men are not saved. There are some, who are Children of Perdition,
There are some, who are Vessels of wrath; there are some who go away into
everlasting punishment, Something must be done, to distinguish you from
that crooked Generation. We read, Matthew 7:14 "Narrow is the way which
leadeth unto life and Few there be that Find it".&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Indeed there is Nothing to be done
by us, to merit our Salvation, But something must be done to secure our
Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Indeed there is Nothing to be done
by us, in our own strength. But something Must be done by us, thro' Christ
who strengthens us.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>More plainly, Our Blessedness now
come not unto us, on the Terms of a Covenant of works, 'Tis not properly
our doings, that is the condition of our Blessedness. We are to be Saved,
by Taking rather than by Doing. The condition is receive and be saved.
It is, approve, and be Saved. Or, Be willing to be Saved. We speak of Doing,
in the Largest sense of the word; and we still say, something must be done,
that we may be Saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Let the Question then come in. And,
Oh! Bring it in with all the Solicitude, which were proper for, the Greatest
Concern in the World.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED?</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>I have seen this Question Scandalously
answered, in Pamphlets that have been dispersed about our Nation. The One
Thing that is needful has been left unregarded, unmention'd. Perhaps the
Observation of certain Superstitious Holidays has been recommended instead
of that one thing. Alas how have the souls of men been betrayed, by men
unskilful in the word of righteousness! How unskilfully, and unfaithfully
have the methods of Salvation been declared by many who pervert the Gospel
of Christ! Not so now I hope! A pure gospel, a sound doctrine, must be
pursu'd, You are now to be treated with nothing but wholesome Words; nothing
but the faithful sayings of God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>I. And what Better, what other Answer
can be given, (Other Foundation can no man Lay!) to this Question, but
what the Apostles of God gave to it of old? When the poor man said what
must I do to be Saved, we read they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and thou shalt be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This is the Sum of the Gospel; This
is the Charge given to the Ministers of the Gospel; Mark 16:15, 16 "Preach
the Gospel to every Creature. He that believeth... shall be saved."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who
is the Only Saviour; This, This must be found in all that will be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The faith, which is, A satisfaction
of the mind in the way of Salvation by a Glorious Christ Revealed in the
Gospel.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Faith by which we deny our selves,
and Rely on a Glorious Christ, for all Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Faith by which we Receive a Glorious
Christ, and Rest on Him for Salvation as He is offered unto us.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But How must this faith operate in
all that would be saved?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh Set! Your Hearts to these things;
they are not vain things; Your Lives, the very Lives of your Souls are
concerned in them.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>If your Hearts may now fall in with
these things, and form'd and shap'd according to the Evangelical Mold of
them lo, This Day Salvation is come unto your souls. Glorious Lord, incline
the hearts of our People, to do what must be done that so thy Salvation
may be bestow'd upon them.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>First this must be done; You must
come to be bitterly Sensible, that you want [lack] a Glorious Christ for
your Saviour.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We read, John 7:37. "If any Man Thirst
let him come unto me." Truly, no man will come to a Christ, until a Thirst
or a pungent and Painful Sense of the Want of a Christ be raised in him.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must feel the Burden of your
sin, lying on you; and cry out, Oh' Tis a heavy Burden too heavy for me!
You must see God Angry with you, Sin Binding of you, Hell gaping for you;
and utterly Despair of helping yourselves out of the confusion that is
come upon you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must be filled with sorrow, for
what you have done; with horror at what you are Expos'd unto. The Cry of
your Uneasy Souls must be that; of Romans 7:24. "O wretched man that I
am who shall deliver me!" You must be no strangers to such soliloquies
as these; I have sinned; I have sinned, and, woe is unto me, that I have
sinned, I have lost the knowledge of God and lost the Image of God, and
lost the Favour of God. My Sin renders me obnoxious to the Vengeance of
God. Lust enchants me, enslaves me; Satan Tyrannizes over me. I am in hourly
Hazzard of an Eternal Banishment from God, into Outer Darkness, into the
Place of Dragons. Oh! wretched man that I am: I can do nothing to deliver
myself. I perish, I perish, except a Glorious Christ be my deliverer.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Degree of this Distress on the
minds of them that shall be saved is Various. There is a Variety in that
Prepatory Work, which does distress the Elect of God, in their coming to
a Saviour. Converts do sometimes needlessly Distress themselves, and Even
deceive themselves, by insisting too much on the Measure of this Preparation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But so much of this Work, as will
render us restless without a Christ; so much of this Work, as will render
a whole Christ precious to us before there must be so much in our Experience,
if we would be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Secondly; This must be Done; You
must confess yourselves, Unable To Do Anything Effectually of yourselves,
in coming to a glorious Christ, as your Saviour.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>With a fearful trembling of Soul,
you must make this Profession; Lord thou worketh in us to Will and to Do,
of thy own good Pleasure!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your Profession must be that of Eph
2:8 "By Grace are ye saved, thro' Faith and that not of yourselves it is
the Gift of God."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your Profession must be that of John
6:65. "No man can come, except it be given to him." Oh! Lie at the Foot
of Soverign Grace confessing and Imploring Lord, I am justly destroyed.
If I do not sincerely renounce my sin, sincerely embrace my Saviour. But
I cannot, Oh! I cannot! I have deadly fetters upon my Soul; I shall never
answer thy gracious Calls, except thy Soverign Grace enable me. Oh! Quicken
me: Oh! Strengthen me: Oh! Enable me; Turn thou me and I Shall be Turned.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your Impotency must not now be made
an Excuse for your Impenitency. Your Inability must Affright you exceedingly.
Affect you Exceedingly; It may not Excuse you in a slothful Negligence.
You must Not Remain Careless of doing anything, Because you can thoroughly
do nothing.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Having first Cry'd unto God, that
He would help you to do what you have to do, you must now try to do it;
now try, whether He do not help you to do it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thirdly; This must be done; You must
Admire, You must Adore, You must Address a Glorious Christ, in all His
offices for all His Benefits. Oh! Hear a Compassionate Redeemer Calling
you; Isai. 45:22 "Look unto me all ye Ends of the Earth, and be ye Saved."
Comply, Reply; Lord, I look unto thee, I will be thine, Save me.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And here, you are to Remember that
the First Thing you want is Attonement and Acceptance with God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>For this Purpose you must behold
a Glorious Christ, as a Priest bringing a Sacrifice and making a Righteousness
for you Accordingly.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your first Address to Heaven must
be this; Lord let my many and horrid sins be Forgiven me for the sake of
that great Sacrifice, which thou hast had in the Blood of Jesus Christ
thy Son, which Cleanseth from all sin. And Lord Let me who am a poor Sinner
utterly hopeless of working out for myself a Righteousness now stand before
Thee in the wondrous Righteousness of that Lord, who is the Head of His
church, and who has wrought out a Spotless Righteousness for us.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But Remember to Depend on this most
sufficient Sacrifice and Righteousness, not as Qualified for it by any
good Thing to be observed in yourselves. Do not stay from it on a Prospect
anon to come recommended unto it by some commendable goodness in yourselves
first attained. No Depend, and Venture upon it, as Encouraged by no other
Qualification but this; A most miserable Sinner; yet invited, yet Compelled
unto this Mercy of the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Well; If the Faith which has got
thus far, be not a counterfeit, it wont stop here. You must behold a glorious
Christ, as a Prophet, and a King. Faith has other errands unto the Saviour
besides that, of a desire to be Justified. A true Believer will not count
himself
saved, if he be not Sanctified, as well as justified.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The Saviour puts this demand unto
you; Matthew 20:32 What will ye that I shall do unto you? You answer; O,
my great Saviour I come unto thee that by thy being my Sacrifice and my
Righteousness and my Advocate, Everliving to make Intercession for me,
I may be Saved unto the Uttermost.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But this must not be all. There must
be this in the Answer, O my Saviour I come unto thee for Instruction: Let
thy Spirit with thy Word cause me to Know the Things of my Peace, and keep
me from all Delusions.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And there must be this in the Answer,
O my Saviour I come unto thee for Government: Let thy Spirit of Grace,
conquer the Enmity of my Heart against the things that are pleasing to
God and make me a conquerer over all my Spiritual Adversaries.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This is that Faith, whereof the End
is the Salvation of the Soul. Believe after this manner, and you believe
to the Saving of the Soul.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>II. But we may carry on the Answer,
without being reproved for adding anything unto the words of God. A true
Faith, will always have Repentance accompanying of it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Repentance unto life; Tis a Dead
Faith which cannot show it; A Dead Soul that has it not,&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>A genuine Faith is always a Repenting
Faith. We see the two sisters hand in hand; Acts 20: 21 Repentance towards
God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. We constantly see it in the
Experience of all the Faithful. 'Tis the Denomination of Repentance; 2
Cor 7:10. Repentance to Salvation. It must be found in all the Candidates
of Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Well then; First; This must be done;
You must heartily and bitterly Bewail all your Sins.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your Original Sin, your Actual Sin;
the monstrous Aggravation of your Sin; You must be convinced of it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>A contrition must follow this conviction;
With a Broken heart you must cry out, Psalm 38:18 "I will declare my iniquity,
I will be sorry for my Sin."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must mourn for your Sin, and
mourn for the Offence given to God by your Sin, as well as for the Mischief
done to yourselves: Mourn, Mourn, and never count that you have mourned
enough.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Secondly; This must be done You must
make a Penitent Confession of your Sins; a Remorseful confession of them,
All your known crimes, you must as particularly as you can, Enumerate with
shame and grief before the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must be able to say; Psalm 51:3,
"I acknowledge my Transgressions and my Sin is ever before me. Your Acknowledgement
of your secret Sins must be only to the Lord: but where your Sins are Known,
where your Neighbors have been either Sufferers by, or Witnesses of your
Miscarriages, they also should Know that you acknowledge them.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thirdly; This must be done; Every
way of Sin must be Abhorr'd, must be Avoided, must be Forsaken.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Amendment is Essential to Repentance:
Except you reform you don't repent. So you are warn'd of God; Prov. 28:13.
"He that confesseth and forsaketh shall find mercy." If you go on in any
Evident way of Sin you will find it a Way of Death, a Path of the Destroyer;
it will bring to a Damnation that slumbereth not.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Very tremendous Things will be done
to those Enemies of God, who go on still in their trespasses. Have you
done Amiss? You must say I will do so no more you must not persist in what
you have done.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And hence, if you have wrong'd another
man in what you have done, you must Vigorously Endeavour all possible restitution,
restitution, a Thing too little understood, too little exhorted, too little
practised; restitution without which there can be no right repentance.
This is the Repentance which is found in every true believer; It must be
found in every one that would be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>III. And, Holiness, Holiness; A patient
continuance in will doing.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>There is No Life in the Faith, which
is not Productive to an Holy Life; 'Tis not a Faith which will bring to
everlasting Life. If the Grace to Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, be
infused into the Soul, the Habit of every other Grace is at the same Instant
infused.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>I will show you the Motto on the
Golden Gates of the Holy City; Hebrews 12:14. "Without Holiness no man
shall see the Lord." An Holy Life, A Life pressing after Universal and
Perpetual conformity to the Rules of Holiness; This, This is the Royal
Path leading to salvation; Yea, tis no little part of our Salvation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This must be done; You must Resign
yourselves up unto the Holy Spirit of the Lord; Consent, Request, Entreat,
That He would Eternally take Posession of you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>From the Dust, cry unto Him; Psalm
141:10. "Thou art my God thy Spirit is good; lead me unto the land of Rectitude."
Cry unto Him; O Spirit of Holiness, Raise me out of the Ruins that my Sin
has brought upon me. Possess me forever. Cause me to fear God, and Love
Christ, and hate Sin, and slight this World and know myself, and make me
meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; Bring me to be one of
them, I pray thee, I pray thee! There is a good Foundation of Holiness
laid in this resignation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But then, This must be done; You
must Livelily Pursue the Death of Every Sin.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must fly to the Death of your
Saviour, as the purchase and the Pattern of so great a Blessing; but you
must count no Trouble too much to be undergone, that you may come at such
a Blessing. This is that Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This must be done: You must set before
yourselves the Example of your Saviour: Study how He was in the World;
Study to walk as He walked; mightily Delight in every stroke of Resemblance
unto Him; Yea, tho' it be in Sufferings that you resemble him. This is
that Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This must be done; You must by a
solemn Dedication of yourselves, and your All unto the Lord, become the
Lord's.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It must therefore be your Desire
to have all your Talents, all your Posessions, and Enjoyments and Interests
employ'd for the Honour of the Lord: and owning the Lord, as the great
Giver, and Owner, the Lord Proprietor of all that you have, you must be
ready to submit unto the will of God when he pleases with afflictive Dispensations
to take any of it from you. This is the Holiness without which no man shall
see the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This must be done; You must remember,
That the Eye of the omnipotent God is upon you,&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must often bring this to remembrance,
God sees me, hears me, knows me, is acquainted with all my ways, A sense
of your being under the Notice of God, and of the Account unto which you
will be called by God must make you afraid of incurring His Displeasure;
Afraid even of Secret Miscarriages. This is that Holiness without which
no man shall see the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>This must be done: You must make
it your Exercise to keep a conscience clear of Offence towards God and
towards Man.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must labour to be Acquainted
with your Whole Duty; and your Acquaintance with the Will of God must be
followed with proportionable Desires and Labours after Obedience to it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must Pray always with all Prayer,
with secret Prayer, with Household Prayer, with Public Prayer.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must have an High Value for those
two Sacraments of the New Testament, the Baptism and the Supper of the
Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must religiously Observe the
Lord's Day.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must Preserve your own Place
and Life and Bed and Wealth and Name: You must, with the same Sincerity,
befriend your Neighbours also in theirs. Love your Neighbours as yourselves,
and Do as you would be Done unto.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You must be especially and mightily
conscientious of Relative Christianity. Carry it well in all the Relations
wherein the Lord has placed you, whether Superiors, or Inferiors, or Equals;
with such a Carriage as may adorn the Doctrine of God your Saviour; such
a Carriage as may render your co-relatives the better for you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Briefly, You must Deny all Ungodliness
and Worldly Lusts and Live godily and soberly and righteously in the World.
This is that Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Methinks a most Obvious Inference
may be drawn from these Things, That the Ministry of the Gospel must be
attended, and not neglected, by them who would not neglect the great Salvation;
A most awful Inference,&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>That it is a dangerous Thing to live
without the means of Salvation, which are in the ministry of the [True]
Gospel ordinarily to be met withal. The Wells of Salvation are kept open
in such a ministry. Oh! Do not undervalue the Blessings of those Upper
Springs! There are men, who by the command of a glorious Christ, give themselves
up unto the service of the Evangelical Ministry, and are the Preachers
of the Gospel unto the rest of the world:&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>An order of men concerning whom our
glorious Lord has promised Matthew 28:20, "Lo, I am with you always to
the end of the world." If an Angel should come from Heaven unto you as
unto Cornelius, once to Speak unto this Question, What must I do to be
saved? He would unquestionably say, Repair to such a ministry don't think
to live without it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We have settled the Point; Without
Faith we can have no Salvation. But I assume: Romans 10:14, 17 "How shall
they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear
without a preacher? Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of
God. Oh! That the Ungospelized Plantations which live, I should rather
say, which die, without the means of salvation, would consider of it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Your Question is answered. O souls
in Peril, I may now say unto you; I Cor. 15:2 "You are saved if you keep
in memory what I have preached unto you." And yet I must say unto you,&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>That if after all, you trample upon
these things, it will be good for you that you had never been born; the
very mention of them will dreadfully increase and inflame your condemnation.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But the success of all must be left
with the Glorious One.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And O Father of mercies, Do thou
mercifully look down upon the Soul that has heard these Things. Dispose
and assist that soul, to do those Good Things, upon which thou hast promised
the salvation of the soul. I Pray thee, I Pray thee!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Awake up my soul! the awful day,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Is coming swiftly on,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>When thou must leave this House
of Clay,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And fly to Worlds unknown.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh! do not pass thy Life in Dreams,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To be surprized by Death:&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And drop unthinking down to Flames,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>When I resign my Breath.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>No: every day thy Course review,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thy real State to learn:&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And with an ardent Zeal pursue&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thy Great and Chief concern.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Rouze all the man: thy Work is great,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And all the man demands;&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thine Head, thine Heart, thy Breath,
thy Sweat,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thy Strength and both thine Hands.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Oh! let the important Work be done,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Done whilst 'tis call'd to Day.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Lest thou the time of Hope out-run,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And rue the mad Delay.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Repent (my soul) Believe and Pray:&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Bid every lust farewell.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To thy Redeemer haste away,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And scape from Death and Hell.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To whom Dear Jesus, should I live&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To whom but Thee alone.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Thou didst at first my being give,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And I am all Thine own.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To Thee I'll then my self devote,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>My Life and all my Pow'rs.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Each warm affection, busy thought,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And all my passing Hours.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>O Let those glorious Hopes refine,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And elevate my Soul.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>To heavenly Things my Heart incline,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And meaner Joys control.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>May Faith and Hope stretch all their
wings,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And bear me up on high;&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>And as I mount may Earthly Things,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Below unheeded lie.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>JESUS my Saviour and my God,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>My Life and Sacrifice,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>My Hopes deep founded in thy Blood,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Raise far above the skies.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Prepare me, Lord, for thy Right
Hand,&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Then come the joyful Day:&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Come Death, and come Celestial band,&nbsp;</font></font>
