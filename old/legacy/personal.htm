Green </b>has been a personal friend of mine for over 15 years.&nbsp; We
first met at a concert in Boca Raton, where Steve was ministering.&nbsp;
We exchanged email addresses and telephone numbers and have kept in touch
ever since, encouraging and stirring oneanother up in the faith.&nbsp;
It's been my privilege to speak to audiences at several of Steve's concerts
on various topics.&nbsp; On February 8, 2003, one week after the Columbia
Space Shuttle tragedy, Steve gave a concert at Coral Ridge Presbyterian
Church in Ft.&nbsp; Lauderdale, Florida.&nbsp; Once again I was invited
by Steve to speak on the subject of trials and suffering.&nbsp; God seemed
to richly bless that evening, as Steve shared some of his personal memories
from his friendship with Rick Husband, Commander of the Columbia mission.&nbsp;
Steve's selection of music, his testimony of Commander Husband and my talk
on trials and suffering, were providentially in orchestrated harmony.&nbsp;
I praise God for this and believe that He was glorified that evening.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve was in attendance for Rick's
first shuttle launch several years ago and was also in attendance for this
launch.&nbsp; He sang both times at pre-launch receptions.&nbsp; He said
the reception for the Columbia launch was very Christ-honoring.&nbsp; Steve
described Rick as a quiet, unassuming man who was, yet, very vocal about
his faith in Christ.&nbsp; He said Rick did not miss an opportunity to
give glory to God and mentioned that when Mission Control said it was a
beautiful day for a launch, Rick responded with, "The Lord has given us
a perfect day!" A suit technician shared the following story with Steve.&nbsp;
He said that after the astronauts suit up they walk down a hallway and
then open a door to "face the press!" Rick stopped the crew before they
opened the door and said he wanted to pray for them.&nbsp; Later the technicians
talked about this and one said that in all his years he had never heard
of a captain praying for and with his crew.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The spouses of the crew each get
to pick a song for them to wake up to one of the mornings they're in space.&nbsp;
Rick's wife selected "God of Wonders" by Steve Green.&nbsp; Steve played
a tape for us of Rick communicating with Mission Control after the song
was played.&nbsp; The conversation went something like this: Mission Control
- "Good morning.&nbsp; That song was for Rick.&nbsp; It was 'God of Wonders'
by Steve Green." Rick - "Good morning.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We can really
appreciate the lyrics of that song up here.&nbsp; We look out the window
and see that God truly is a God of wonders!" Steve also shared part of
an e-mail he received from Rick, transmitted from outer space! Rick wrote
about how overwhelming it was to see God's vast creation from space.&nbsp;
He said he had never cried while exercising before, but peddling on the
bike and looking out the window at God's incredible creation brought tears
to his eyes.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve then sang several selections
from his latest CD "Woven in Time".&nbsp; He then spoke about our mutual
friendship and proceeded to ask me the following questions:&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve: "Why is there suffering in
the world?"&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Johnny: "The Scriptures tell us,
that all suffering and eventually death is a result of man's rebellion
against God, which first took root in the Garden of Eden." "God cursed
man and all of creation".&nbsp; (Romans 5).&nbsp; However, the good news
is that God so loved the world, that He sent His Son into the world to
restore man and to create a new heaven and a new earth".&nbsp; (John 3:16
and Revelation 21:1).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Yet, I believe that suffering was
also necessary, in order to show the immense character of God's love, mercy
and compassion.&nbsp; This is best displayed at the Cross.&nbsp; Jesus
said, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His
work." (John 4:34).&nbsp; The last words Jesus said on the cross was, "it
is finished"! And in the cross of Christ, all suffering and death is finished."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve: "How has suffering affected
your relationship with God?"&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Johnny: "The best way I can answer
that question is to borrow the words of King David when he says in Ps.&nbsp;
119:71 - "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn
Your statutes." I also identify with Joni Eareckson Tada, who refers to
suffering as her "strange friend".&nbsp; Suffering and trials have helped
me to realize, that I must fully rely upon God for all things.&nbsp; They
help me let go of this world and eagerly look forward to eternity with
Christ.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>"When I'm experiencing intense pain,
frustration and discouragement, I often think of the portrait painted by
Scripture of the Apostle John with his head laying on the bosom of our
Lord.&nbsp; (John 13:22).&nbsp; When meditating upon this passage, I sometimes
sense the Lord's bosom resting under my head."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve: "What advice would you give
to those who are presently going through difficult trials?"&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Johnny: "First I would remind them
that though their trial may not be pleasant, to remember that God is sovereign.&nbsp;
He is not unfamiliar with their suffering.&nbsp; He suffered, so that He
could sympathize with us and comfort us in all our trials.&nbsp; (Hebrews
4:15).&nbsp; Next I would encourage you to embrace your suffering.&nbsp;
Our hearts are so pridefull.&nbsp; With our advanced technology and medicines,
we try to fix all our problems.&nbsp; But we can't.&nbsp; Only God can.&nbsp;
Steve, you have a song entitled, "Embrace the Cross".&nbsp; I want to encourage
others to embrace their cross.&nbsp; The cross that God has called them
to bare.&nbsp; For it's in our weakness where God's grace and strength
is made manifest.&nbsp; This brings glory to our God.&nbsp; Suffering is
the very vehicle for which God draws us into intimacy with Himself.&nbsp;
It's through suffering that we are sanctified and made fit for Heaven.&nbsp;
(Philippians 3:10)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Steve then dedicated his next song
"Refiner's Fire" to me and closed the concert by singing "A Mighty Fortress"
and "Amazing Grace".&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Immediately following the concert,
I was surrounded by countless numbers of people, who began telling me of
some of the difficult trials they were facing.&nbsp; They gave testimony
how God visited them through the things I had shared that evening.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>It's tremendously delightful and
fulfilling to be used of God, to bless others and to reflect His glory!
I thank my God for allowing me this privilege and opportunity to serve
Him.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Please pray for Steve as he continues
to serve our God through his gifts and talents.&nbsp; You can check out
his web site by clicking the photo of Steve and myself at the beginning
