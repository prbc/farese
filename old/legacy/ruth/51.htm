<P>Books are great to read and most everybody reads some books at sometime
or other. But there is ONE BOOK that is essential to read, or have read
to you, if your name is going to be written in the most important, and
priceless book; a book that everyone will hope to find their name written
in one day. This book is called THE BOOK OF LIFE (Phil. 4:3). It is the
book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8).
It is the Lord Jesus Christ’s book; the Lamb of God that came to take away
the sin of the world (Jn. 1:29).&nbsp;

<P>The book that you must read if you want your name written in the book
of life is the Holy Bible. It is God’s infallible word, written by men
that were inspired by God, and given the words by God, so that all men
might know Him, love Him, serve Him, and be saved by Him (II Pet. 1:20-21).
Faith only comes by hearing (or reading) the word of God (Rom. 10:17).

<P>The great tragedy is that few spend much time reading this book, and
because they don’t, they will find on judgment day that this was the greatest
mistake of their lives. Any not found written in the book of life are cast
into the lake of fire – the place of the second death - eternal death (Rev.
20:14-15).&nbsp;

<P>There is a great white throne judgment coming and the books will be
opened; all the books that God is keeping of everyone that has ever lived;
of all that they have thought, said, and done. And another book will be
opened - THE BOOK OF LIFE - and all the dead will be judged according to
their works and the things written in the books (Rev. 20:11-12).&nbsp;

<P>Everybody is thinking about what will happen on January 1, 2000; many
are preparing, going to great expense. WHAT ABOUT JUDGMENT DAY? Are we
prepared? Are we ready? Are we sure (II Pet. 1:10)?&nbsp;

<P>The only way to escape the terrible judgment of God’s wrath will be
by the Lord writing your name in HIS BOOK OF LIFE. He warns us all - He
says to the church at Sardis, His own people, "You have a name that you
live but you are dead."

<P>Let us heed the warning while there is yet time. If we overcome our
sin by doing what the Lord says, we shall have assurance that all is well
with our souls. But if not, <U>He</U> <U>will</U> <U>blot</U> <U>out</U>
<U>our</U> <U>names</U> <U>from</U> <U>the</U> <U>book</U> <U>of</U> <U>life</U>.

<P>May we have ears to hear what the Spirit says to us in these last days
(Rev. 3:1-6).</TD>
