<P>Did you know that the name, Jehovah, has three syllables that contain
the notes of all times: Je, the time to come; ho, the time present; vah,
the time past?&nbsp;

<P>When God promised some special mercy, or some extraordinary judgment
was threatened, the name, Jehovah, was annexed to show that God whose being
is from Himself, and who has given a being to all creatures in heaven and
in earth, will certainly give a being to His promises and threatenings.
He will never fail to accomplish the words that He has spoken.&nbsp;

<P>Moses knew this name of God because his mother’s name was Jochebed,
which means Jehovah her glory (Ex. 6:20). Now much more is to be revealed
than was revealed to the patriarchs (Ex. 6:2-3). Now its full precious
meaning is about to be revealed.&nbsp;

<P>When God revealed His name to Moses as "I AM THAT I AM" (Ex. 3:14),
He was expressing "unchanging Being" – unchangeably faithful in keeping
His word (Mal. 3:6). Now Moses was going to see the word of God experimentally
worked out in living acts.&nbsp;

<P>Later on we know that God revealed "His Word" to him. Knowing this,
and seeing this by faith, he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches
than the treasures of Egypt. He endured because he saw Him who was invisible,
the Word, the Word who was in the beginning, and was with God, and was
God. (Heb. 11:24-27, 13:8, Jn. 1:1).

<P>God gave a being to His word when the Word became flesh (Jn. 1:14).
All the promises and threatenings of God are seen in the Lord Jesus Christ.
He lived and died fulfilling all the word, and will of God, to God’s glory
and the good of man.

<P>Dear Christian, if God is your portion, all things are yours now (I
Cor. 3:21). All things are prepared, ordered, and ordained by God to work
for the good of His people, to increase their holiness, happiness, and
blessedness. All the gifts, graces, and experiences of the ministers of
the gospel are for your information, edification, confirmation, consolation,
and salvation. All changes, all conditions, and all occurrences are sure
to be for your profit, and work for your good, if God is your portion and
the Love of your life (Rom. 8:28).

<P>Think of this when you are "blue" or "down in the dumps." If God is
your portion and your hope, every promise is yours, every attribute of
God is working for your good, every privilege, every comfort, every blessing,
every mercy – all is yours, because you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s
(I Cor. 3:21-23). If God spared not His own Son – how shall He not <U>with</U>
<U>Him</U>, <U>freely</U> <U>give</U> <U>us</U> <U>all</U> <U>things</U>
(Rom. 8:32)?
