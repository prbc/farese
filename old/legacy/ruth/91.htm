<center><b><font size=+2>HIS SEED</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises
made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy
seed, which is Christ" (Gal. 3:16).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A master gardener is very careful about the
seed that he plants.&nbsp; It must be not only clean and pure, but the
best and most excellent of its kind.&nbsp; He always casts in the best,
the principal wheat (Isa. 28:25).&nbsp; He knows that according to the
vigor and goodness of the seed, so shall be the fruit and production.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Lord's garden were to grow, He had to
create a new seed.&nbsp; All the seed in the whole world had become corrupt
through Adam's sin (Rom. 5:12).&nbsp; So the Lord called Abraham and established
a new covenant with him (Gen. 22:18).&nbsp; He promised him that through
his seed (which is Christ) men, women, and children could become heirs
of God through Christ Jesus (Gal. 3:26-29).&nbsp; This is the only seed
now that has life within it.&nbsp; It is because this seed is the seed
of God (I Jn. 3:9).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God must now plant "this seed" within us if
we are to be "His garden".&nbsp; Only He has it, and only He can give it.&nbsp;
He invites all of us to come to Him and receive it.&nbsp; It is the word
of God, the living word - the Son of God (Lk.8:11, Jn. 1:1, 12-14).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All who aren't in Christ are dead.&nbsp; The
first seed died in Adam and can never produce life again (I Cor. 15:22).&nbsp;
We are all dead in sin without Christ (Eph. 2:1). We can never produce
the fruit of the Spirit without being born-again (Jn. 3:3,5).&nbsp; We
must be a new creation (II Cor. 5:17).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear reader, is this seed in you?&nbsp; If
it isn't, the Lord says you are a tree whose fruit will wither; you will
be without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots (Jude 12).&nbsp;
God forbid!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, listen to what the Lord says.&nbsp; "Ho,
everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money;
come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without
price.&nbsp; Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? And
your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me,
and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.&nbsp;
Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your soul shall live; and
I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of
David" (Isa. 55:1-3)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sure mercies are listed in II Samuel 22:1-51.&nbsp;
Read about them, believe them, ask for them yourself, and&nbsp; you shall
become His seed - an heir of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God help you to do it.</td>
