<P>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; for You are with me" (Psa. 23:4).&nbsp;

<P>It is summer and the sheep leave their home range for "higher ground."
The shepherd takes his sheep through the valleys because it is a more gentle
grade up to the mountain tops. It is also where they can be constantly
refreshed by the many rivers, streams, and springs. The valleys are also
where the richest feed and best forage is found. But here also is a place
of danger - the shadow of death is always seen. There are coyotes, bears,
wolves, and cougars that take cover in the cliffs, and prey on the flock.
Sudden storms and flash floods can send walls of water down the slopes.
There are many natural disasters that could destroy or injure the sheep;
yet the shepherd knows that this is the best route to "higher ground."&nbsp;

<P>Our Good Shepherd has warned us of the dangers, but we need not fear;
He is with us, and He has overcome the world (Jn. 16:33).&nbsp;

<P>Let us walk <U>through</U> our valleys with confidence in our faithful
Shepherd. We will find it to be a good thing for us, because here we are
alone with our Shepherd, and He will teach us what we need to know (Psa.
119:71,75).&nbsp;

<P>Though the shadow of death may seem dark, <U>it</U> <U>is</U> <U>only</U>
<U>a</U> <U>shadow</U>, and we can walk right through it; we will not die
here.&nbsp;

<P>As we go up the mountain, even though it is rocky in places, we will
be finding more and more green pastures. We will discover that the darkness
is getting lighter and lighter (Psa. 18:28), and our path is getting wider
so that our feet are not slipping (Psa. 18:36). Our Shepherd is slowly
bringing us out of darkness, and the shadow of death. He is breaking our
chains of sin in pieces so that we can be totally free from all fear (Psa.
107:14).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, let us sing for joy!! We are on our way to the Lord’s house. It
sits right on top of the mountain. Let us say to all the nations around
us, "Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, To the house of
the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths"
(Isa. 2:2-3).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, sheep of the Lord – kick your feet, and leap for joy. We are almost
there!!!</TD>
