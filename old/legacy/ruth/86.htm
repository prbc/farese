<p>"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to
his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray" (Mk. 14:32).&nbsp;
<p>If the seed is to be planted and grow well the soil must first be cultivated.&nbsp;
The ground must be worked; made free from rocks, weeds, and bugs that would
kill the plants.&nbsp;
<p>Come with me now into the garden that Adam made - it is called Gethsemane.
There are no sweet-smelling flowers in this garden.&nbsp; This garden is
full of thorns and thistles; thorns so sharp, so filled with poison, that
they cause great pain, suffering and death.&nbsp; There is a name for these
thorns;&nbsp; they are called "sin."&nbsp;
<p>The master Gardener has come into this garden now to consume these thorns
- to make the ground good.&nbsp; He worked so hard that He sweat blood
(Lk. 22:44).&nbsp;
<p>"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
be made the righteousness of God in him" (II Cor. 5:21).&nbsp; His body
was the food and fertilizer to make the ground good; His blood, the necessary
water to give life to His plants.
<p>Let us make sure that we have been planted in this good ground by our
heavenly Father.&nbsp; If we haven't been, we shall be rooted up (Matt.
15:13).
<p>We must be rooted and grounded in love, built up in Him (Christ), and
established in the faith (Eph. 3:17, Col. 2:7).&nbsp; Only He can give
it (Rom. 5:5).&nbsp; Ask Him for it - it is free - it is necessary -&nbsp;
it is vital (Jn. 3:3, I Jn. 4:7-13).
<p>Oh Lord, till your garden; break up our fallow ground; take out the
rocks of pride and self-righteousness; kill the weeds of selfishness; get
rid of all the bugs of covetousness that are eating away our life.&nbsp;
Cultivate us and sow your precious seed in us - the seed of Christ - the
hope of glory (Col. 1:27).&nbsp; Only then will we be a living plant.
<p>Regeneration is not the improvement of the flesh, or the cultivation
of the old nature. It is the receiving of an altogether new and heavenly
nature; a giving of a new heart, and a new spirit within, taking out the
stony heart, enabling us to live a new life to the glory of God (Ezek.
11:19:20).
