<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS GIRDLE (Revelation 1:13)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>All soldiers in biblical times wore a girdle. It was made of leather,
and kept the armor in its place. The sword was slung on the girdle, carried
in a sheath, and rested upon the thigh. Even the ordinary men and women
wore girdles in those days. Their robes and garments were loose, and the
girdle held them tightly around them so that they could run or fight. Girdles
are still worn today to strengthen the body, enabling the person to lift
heavy objects.&nbsp;

<P>The Scriptures tell us that the "girdle" we are to put on is a girdle
of truth - the truth of God (Eph. 6:14). How can we do this? Only by one
way - by putting on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 13:14). He is the Truth,
the whole Truth, the living Truth, and our armor is complete in Him (Jn.
14:6, Col. 2:10).&nbsp;

<P>Because He is the Truth, His girdle held His sword firm and secure,
and strengthened Him to fight the battle for life. He kept it tightly clasped
on Him by much prayer, and we must do the same.&nbsp;

<P>Look with me now and see how His girdle strengthened Him to bear all
His heavy burdens, and to fight and conquer all His enemies.&nbsp;

<P>See Him in agony of spirit and mind as He struggles under the burden
of bearing all our iniquities (Isa. 53:11). Hear Him as He says, "Father,
if it is your will, take this cup away from Me, nevertheless not My will,
but Yours be done" (Lk. 22:42). "Love suffers long and is kind; love does
not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave
rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not
rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes
all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails" (I
Cor. 13:4-8).&nbsp;

<P>See Him as He says to Judas, "What you do, do quickly," knowing that
he is going off to betray Him for thirty pieces of silver, yet He never
openly told anyone of the evil that this man was going to do to Him, even
though He knew about it from the beginning (Jn. 6:70-71, 13:27). He was
always faithful and true. "A talebearer reveals secrets, but he who is
of a faithful spirit conceals a matter" (Prov. 11:13).&nbsp;

<P>See Him as Judas comes to give Him the kiss of death, and hear Him as
the words of grace and truth flow from His mouth. "Friend, why have you
come" (Matt. 26:50)? "A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born
for adversity" (Prov. 17:17). " He who covers a transgression seeks love,
But he who repeats a matter separates friends" (Prov. 17:9).&nbsp;

<P>See Him on the cross as the two thieves begin to revile Him. Then one
hears and believes, and the living truth of God is seen again (Matt. 27:44,
Luke 23:34, 42-43). "When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his
enemies to be at peace with him" (Prov. 16:7).&nbsp;

<P>No wonder He sits in heaven now, not with a leather girdle, but a GOLDEN
GIRDLE (Rev. 1:13). His words have been purified seven times in the furnace
of earth. They are not only as silver, but as pure gold (Psa. 12:6).&nbsp;

<P>Oh Lord, who is a God like You who delights in showing mercy and passes
over transgressions (Mic. 7:18).&nbsp;

<P>May we now, as God's people, fulfill the laws of Christ, bearing one
another's burdens, and loving our enemies (Gal. 6:2, Matt. 5:44-45).&nbsp;

<P>Perhaps then, our girdle will become golden as His.</TD>
