<center><b><font size=+1>HIS GRAFTING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And if some of the branches be broken off,
and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with
them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; Boast not against
the branches; But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root
thee" (Rom. 11:17-18).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grafting is a method of propagation by which
an artificial union is made between a scion (a shoot or bud cut from a
plant) of one plant and the rootstock of another so that they eventually
function as one plant.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Lord made us "His garden" He had to
cut us out of a wild olive tree (one that was useless and profitless) and
grafted us into His good olive tree.&nbsp; Our root was rotten, so in His
mercy, and by His grace, He grafted us into His holy rootstock (Rom. 11:16-26).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gentile church is the wild twig "engrafted
contrary to nature" on the original Jewish olive stock; it shows supernatural
virtue in the stock because it enables those wild by nature to bear good
fruit.&nbsp; Ordinarily it is only a superior scion that is grafted on
an inferior.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grafting is painful; both the rootstock and
the scion have to be cut into and then bound together.&nbsp; Thankfully
we have a master Gardener that never loses any of His living plants (Jn.
10:28).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we now heed our Gardener's warning and
not fall into unbelief as Israel did.&nbsp; Let us not be highminded, but
fear.&nbsp; We must continue in His goodness or we also shall be cut off
(Rom. 11:20-22).&nbsp; This is not a contradiction.&nbsp; It would only
happen because we were never really His.&nbsp; God must be true to all
His word.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh dear Lord, keep us from the damning sin
of unbelief.&nbsp; Increase our faith and love for you.&nbsp; Order our
steps in your word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over us (Psa.
119:133).
