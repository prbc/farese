<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the
living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of
the earth after his kind; and it was so" (Gen. 1:24).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you know that there are approximately 200
million bugs for each person in the world and only l% of them are harmful
to man?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may not like them, and try to kill them,
but they are God's bugs, created by Him.&nbsp; They are the means to pollinate
fruits, flowers, and vegetables.&nbsp; They return nutrients to the soil
by eating vegetation.&nbsp; We couldn't live without them.&nbsp; They are
essential to a garden and a healthy overall environment.&nbsp; This is
why our Master Gardener has so many of them in His garden, even though
they keep "bugging us."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are the people that are always correcting
us; some are the people that are always criticizing us; some are those
that are always arguing with us; some are those that never do what we want
them to do, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will we learn that all these "bugs" are
there to help us kill the "bugs" that are killing us, and therefore helping
us to grow better; "bugs" like pride, self-righteousness, self-confidence,
anger, bitterness, unbelief, etc.&nbsp; These "bugs" are there to kill
"our bugs" so that we can manifest the life of our Lord.&nbsp; These "bugs"
are our opportunities to die daily (Lk. 9:23:24).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will we believe that "all things are for
our sakes" and keep asking our beloved Gardener for His bug killer - His
grace to kill ours?&nbsp; If we do this, then all that will come out of
our mouths will impart grace to those that hear us (II Cor. 4:7-15, Eph.
4:29-32).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not lose heart and rot out our "heartwood"
or we may be found hollow (without judgment, mercy, faith, and love) at
the last day.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not faint.&nbsp; Our Gardener is always
faithful, even if we aren't (II Cor. 4:16, Lam. 3:22-23).
