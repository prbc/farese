<center><font size=+1>HIS THORNS</font>
<br><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></center>

<p>"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying,
Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns and thistles shall
it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field" (Gen.
3:17-18).
<p>The Lord says, "As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters."&nbsp;
His lilies, His sheep, are often getting pierced and caught in the "thorns."&nbsp;
These "thorns" are not pleasant; they cause continual pain and discomfort
if they are not pulled out right away.
<p>The Lord knows all about "thorns."&nbsp; They crowned His head and pierced
His skin; He knows how painful they are.&nbsp; But let us never forget
that they are His thorns.&nbsp; He has created them for a good and wise
purpose.
<p>Paul learned this truth and therefore he could most gladly bear with
all that the Lord gave him (II Cor. 12:7-10),&nbsp; So did Job.&nbsp; When
he saw and heard of God's strength and wisdom, he didn't complain anymore
(Job 38:1-40:4).
<p>Oh, may we train our minds, by God's grace, to see that all the thorns
that pierce us are just the spoils of our enemies, and we are to take these
and use them to build the house of the Lord just as David did.&nbsp; He
saved all the spoils for his son, Solomon, to build the glorious temple
of the Lord (I Ch. 29:19).
<p>Our enemies can only take from us that which is perishing for that is
the only power that they have.&nbsp; But our Savior can take the sin (the
evil) that rises up within us when they
<br>wound us, and turn it into pure gold to build His temple, as we submit
gladly to His working, turning the evil into good and glory (Jas. 1:2-4).&nbsp;
<p>When the Lord moves us out of our comfortable pattern of life, let us
see this as "His green pastures" that He has prepared for us, and feed
upon them.&nbsp; He will always give joy for sorrow, peace for anxiety,
love for hatred, wisdom for foolishness, riches for poverty, strength for
weakness, comfort for discomfort, and life for death.&nbsp; See every "thorn"
as a means to produce a beautiful lily - His lily - whose glory will be
even greater than Solomon's (Matt. 6:28-30).&nbsp;
<p>The Lord mastered and ruled over all His pain, and because He did, His
crown of thorns was turned into a glorious crown of life.&nbsp; He will
do the same for us as we follow Him wherever He goes (Jas. 1:12).
<p>"Behold your master Gardener!"&nbsp;
