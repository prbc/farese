<P>If anyone is to be healthy and strong, he must eat the right food; the
food that God has made and created for him. Each life has its own nature,
and must eat food to sustain its life. The diet of birds and lions differs
greatly from ours.

<P>God gave us a spiritual nature when He saved us. If we are to live spiritually,
we must eat spiritual food. The Lord said His food was to do the will of
God and to finish His work (Jn. 4:34). He lived on the words of His Father,
and was enabled to digest them all, living them out in His life, even though
some were very bitter. We must do the same if we are to be enabled to live
to His glory.

<P>We must eat a "balanced diet," though. If we do not, we will not grow
well; we will be lacking in joy, peace, and contentment. We must be careful
not to eat more of the bitter herbs (examine yourself, lament, mourn, and
weep), than the sweet meat of the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
the world. ( Jas. 4:9, Jn. 1:29). There must always be bitter herbs served
with the Lord’s passover, but after killing the lamb, sprinkling the blood
on the door posts, eating the roasted flesh with the unleavened bread and
bitter herbs, we are set free to travel to the "promised land" (Ex. 12:1-11).&nbsp;

<P>Freedom for God’s people from the slavery of Egypt was not a day by
day experience; it was a one time event. So it is with our justification.
On the day that we believe and receive the Lord, we are justified freely
by His grace (Jn. 1:12-13, Rom. 3:24). We are no longer under the dominion
of sin (Rom. 6:14); there is no more condemnation (Rom. 5:1).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, may we live as sons and daughters, feeding on the word of the Lord,
and not as slaves (Jn. 6:57-63). He says, "And I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out
of my hand" (Jn. 10:28). He will continue to work in us to will and to
do (Phil. 2:13); He will continue to meet all our needs (Phil. 4:19); He
will continue to love us, eternally (Rom. 8:35-39). May we not keep eating
more than is necessary of the bitter herbs, but more of the Lamb that produces
joy unspeakable, and full of glory (I Pet. 1:8, Jer. 15:16). Perhaps then,
more lost people will desire to know our Lord. Their lives are filled with
enough sorrow already; they are not looking for any more.

<P>Oh Christian, eat a "balanced diet" every day! There is no other way
to be healthy, holy, and happy.</TD>
