<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, Jesus , have sent mine angel to testify
unto you these things in the churches.&nbsp; I am the root and the offspring
of David, and the bright and morning star" (Rev. 22:16).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roots are the underground anchor for all plants.&nbsp;
They absorb the moisture and mineral nutrients from the soil that help
feed the plant.&nbsp; The roots send the gathered moisture and nutrients
to the shoots, laterals, branches, limbs, and trunks of the trees which
are above ground.&nbsp; Roots also store some of the nutrients generated
by the leaves and make chemical compounds that help regulate the growth
of the foliage.&nbsp; The health and life of the tree will be according
to the health and state of the root.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is now only one root in the whole world
that has life in it; it is the Root of Jesse; the root and offspring of
David (Isa. 10:11), the Lord Jesus Christ (Jn. 14:6).&nbsp; He is the anchor
of the soul, both sure and steadfast (Heb. 6:19).&nbsp; We all must have
this Root within us or we will not be "His Garden" - we will be lost, without
life, and without God (Matt. 13:6).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a tree is to grow strong and tall its roots
must grow and sink deeply into the ground.&nbsp; We must grow down if we
are to grow up, and be strong.&nbsp; (Oaks are rooted when the storm blows
the hardest.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pride and self-righteousness are rooted so
deeply, and strongly, in our nature that usually only the heart-breaking
trials (the Lord's&nbsp; fertilizer) will get rid of these old rotten roots
so that the root of David will grow and make our tree a tree of righteousness
- a tree that is the planting of the Lord (Isa. 92:12-14).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of tomorrow is rooted in the pain
and suffering of today.&nbsp; God took David's child to cure him of the
sin of adultery (II Sam. 12:14).&nbsp; God gave Paul a thorn in the flesh
to cure him of the sin of pride (II Cor. 12:7).&nbsp; God took all that
Job had to cure him of self-righteousness (Job 32:2, 40:4)&nbsp; Surely
we have more cause to bless God for all our troubles&nbsp; instead of murmuring
and complaining when He shows such love to us by killing our sins by means
of our trials and chastisements.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus
the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished
in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."&nbsp;
If we do this, we shall not only grow like the lily, but we shall be as
the cedars of Lebanon, deeply rooted, firm and strong, decaying very slowly
and always with a sweet aroma (Hos. 14:5).
