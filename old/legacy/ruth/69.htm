<p>
Joseph was God's child, and as a young boy God revealed to him that one day he would rule over his brothers, and they hated him more for that (Gen. 37:2-8).  As a result, when they had the opportunity they threw him into a pit.  They were thinking of killing him, but Judah suggested that they sell him for twenty pieces of silver, and they did to some passing merchantmen (Gen. 37:17-28).
<p>
As a result Joseph spent many years in a foreign land, mistreated, and thrown into prison because his master's wife lied about him.  He was tried by great affliction, even chained with irons for a long while.  The word of the Lord tried him, but he remained faithful to his God, and to His word, because his God was faithful to him; He would never leave him or forsake him (Gen. 39:2, 20-22, Psa. 105:17-19, Heb. 13:5).
<p>
Perhaps you are living in a situation with some member of your family who is not treating you well, and the burden is very heavy; you do not know if you can continue.
<p>
Study Joseph's life, and see in your own life that faithfulness to God, believing His word, trusting in His promises, and doing His will by loving your enemies, (even if they turn out to be your brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, or children) giving good back for evil, will one day in God's time, turn out to be great glory for you; but more important, great glory to God as it was for Joseph (II Cor. 3:18, 4:15-18).
<p>
It may be a long dark night for you, but God is always working in the night for you, as He was for him.  "All things are possible to him that believes" (Mk. 9:23).  You may not see God working, as the children of Israel did not see God working all that night, but God was causing the sea to go back ALL THAT NIGHT (Ex. 14:21).
<p>
Trust Him, wait on Him, be faithful to do His will in the suffering; it is your calling and mine (I Pet. 2:19-21).  God has a wonderful purpose in it all.  He will use us as He did Joseph to not only preserve life, but to save much people alive (Gen. 45:5, 50:15-21).  We shall become fruitful boughs, even fruitful boughs by a well - well-watered and continually bearing fruit (Gen. 41:52, 49:22).
<p>
May we who are not passing through this "long, dark night" right now, not be at ease, unconcerned for the needs of our afflicted brethren, but rather helping them, ministering to them in any way that we can (Amos 6:1-6).
<p>
May we show ourselves to be "His Joseph," always believing that God, our Maker, gives songs in the night (Job 35:10), and may we sing them as Moses and the people sang, "The Lord is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation" (Ex. 15:2).
