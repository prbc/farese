<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you hath he quickened, who were dead in
trespasses and sins" (Eph. 2:1).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in a while all gardeners discover that
some of their plants, or at times all of them,&nbsp; have died.&nbsp; It
can be a great loss to them if they have a large garden and have spent
much money on the plants, fertilizers, tools, and watering system. Besides
there are the hours, days, and weeks spent working in it trying to keep
it all alive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks be unto God that we have a Master Gardener
that never loses any of His plants (Jn. 10:28).&nbsp; His plants were all
dead when He bought them, and only He had the right medicine to bring them
back to life (Jn. 11:25-26, I Cor. 6:20).&nbsp; It was a "seed" that they
had to take - to receive - that would not only restore them to life, but
enable them to live forever.&nbsp; It was, and is, the Seed of God, the
Lord Jesus Christ (Jn. 1:12-13, Gal. 3:16).&nbsp; This Seed, when it is
planted in us causes us to die again to ourselves, so that we might live
unto God (Col. 2;20, 3:3); we become dead to sin (Rom. 6:11-12), dead to
the law (Rom. 7:4), crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20, 5:24).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you taken this "Seed"?&nbsp; Have you
received it personally from Him?&nbsp; He is the only one that can give
it to you.&nbsp; You must come to Him (Jn. 14:6).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This "Seed" has such power in it that even
if you begin to wilt and die again, it will revive you.&nbsp; You will
find, then, that you will be even stronger and more beautiful than before.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, what a Gardener!!&nbsp; Oh, what a Savior!!!&nbsp;
Do you know Him?&nbsp; Do you love Him?&nbsp; Is His life in you?&nbsp;
Is He your life?&nbsp; Nothing less than this will bring you to life and
keep you alive (I Cor. 16:22).</td>
