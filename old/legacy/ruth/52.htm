<P>The stars are part of God’s creation, and as all that God has created,
they are not only good, but beautiful and useful as well.

<P>When God revealed to the wise men the coming of Christ into the world,
he showed them His star, the star that is the Bright and Morning Star (Rev.
22:16).

<P>Dear fellow-sufferer with Christ, look for <U>this</U> <U>Star</U> continually,
especially if you are seeing a great darkness as Abraham did - a darkness
of affliction (Gen. 15:12-13).&nbsp;

<P>Remember that this darkness, this suffering, is achieving for you a
greater weight of glory (II Cor. 4:17). It will show you your eternal inheritance
as it did to Abraham.

<P>God not only gave Abraham a child and a land; He gave him Himself, as
his reward (Gen. 15:1). No wonder Paul writes, and prays, that we might
know the riches of the glory of <U>HIS</U> <U>INHERITANCE</U> in the saints
(Eph. 1:18). It is His glory that He is giving to us, and who can estimate
the preciousness of this. It is the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph.
3:8).

<P>Let us pray for God to open our eyes in this darkness of life - the
darkness of evil - to enable us to see His star - the Bright and Morning
Star. It will arise in all its glory once again, and the world will know
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God. This God is our portion,
our Inheritance, forever.

<P>Let us follow His star as the wise men did, and we will surely come
to see the child that was born, whose name is Wonderful, Counselor, The
Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6).

<P>Dear reader, to you who have not seen His star. Look up to the heavens,
and see His stars, the stars that He has created, and know that HE IS.
Can anything come out of nothing???

<P>This Christmas, do not be unbelieving, for if you live to see His star
as the Bright and Morning Star coming again without believing, it will
be too late for you. The day of grace will be over. You will be a wandering
star in the blackness of darkness, <U>forever</U> (Jude 13).

<P>May you be wise as the wise men were, and follow His star until you
come to Him. May God make it so for you, even this day (Heb. 3:7-13).&nbsp;
