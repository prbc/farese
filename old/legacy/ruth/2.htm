<P>Oh, how many times do we feel as though our God has forgotten about
us. We go mourning all the day.&nbsp;

<P>Let us not forget that GOD IS OUR ROCK -- MY ROCK. He is the Rock that
was smitten for us that the water of life could freely flow forth (Numbers
20:11, Isaiah 53:4). Oh, come to this Rock and drink abundantly and you
will discover that it will become in you a fountain of water springing
up into everlasting life.&nbsp;

<P>Take this water and water your garden with it so that the beautiful
forget-me-nots of God may grow and flourish in it. He has engraved us on
the palms of His hands. We may forget Him, but He will never forget us
(Isaiah 49:15-16).&nbsp;

<P>Cry unto THIS ROCK (Psa. 28:1). He will hear your prayers. He is not
as the rocks of the earth. He is the LIVING ROCK, the Chief Cornerstone,
elect, and precious, the sure foundation of His church (I Pet. 2:6, I Cor.
10:4). Let the name ISHMAEL live in your minds. It means GOD IS HEARING.
Surely if God heard the cry of Hagar's affliction, an Egyptian woman, He
will hear you, His dear child. Do not be cast down if the Lord seems not
to answer your prayer. His not answering is an answer. He says wait on,
pray on, and you will see the glory of God.&nbsp;

<P>This was the case of the woman of Canaan who came to the Lord begging
mercy for her daughter that was vexed with a devil. The Scripture says,
"He answered her not a word" (Matt. 15:22-23). His silence is not a "no"
but the blessed means to keep you standing on Him, resting in Him, depending
on Him and worshipping Him.&nbsp;

<P>Hide yourself in this Rock, this Rock that was cleft (opened up by the
nails, the spear and the lash) for you. It is a place of protection and
comfort, and you will be safe from that which would harm you (S.O.S. 2:14).&nbsp;

<P>Be sure and eat much of the honey that comes out of THIS ROCK which
is the fullness of grace in the Lord Jesus Christ, His covenant, His promises,
His gospel, and you will find that it will greatly sweeten the most bitter
cup.&nbsp;

<P>May we not be as the people of Israel that came out of Egypt that ate
this honey, yet forsook God and lightly esteemed the Rock of His Salvation.
May we be satisfied with Him (Deut. 32:9-15).&nbsp;
