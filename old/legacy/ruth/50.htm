<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS THANKSGIVING (Jn. 11:41-42)</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>As we come to enjoy a day that we call Thanksgiving let us learn from
the Lord what a blessing it is to be thankful – even to be thankful for
all things, and in all things (Eph. 5:20, I Th. 5:18).&nbsp;

<P>When the Lord went to the grave of Lazarus to raise him from death,
He began His prayer by saying, "Father, I thank You that You have heard
Me and I know that You always hear Me" (Jn. 11:41-42). He then commanded
Lazarus to come forth from the dead.

<P>Though we cannot literally give life to the physically dead, we may
be used of God in His purpose to give life to the spiritually dead. We
will have to begin where the Lord began though, by knowing and thanking
God that He has heard us, and always hears us. But we can only be sure
of this if we are His people, and are living in obedience to His word.

<P>The Lord also gave thanks to His Father and rejoiced in spirit that
He was the Sovereign Ruler - Lord of heaven and earth (Lk. 10:21). May
we do the same.

<P>The Lord says all things are for our sakes (II Cor. 4:15). If we truly
believe this, then we will obey the Lord and be thankful for all things
and in all things. People around us will then see the power of the risen
Lord as we manifest His life and His grace. This will then cause thanksgiving
to abound to the glory of God (II Cor. 4:11,15).

<P>Oh, let us not lose heart in our difficult times. Let us know that our
Father always hears us, and thank Him continually for this most blessed
privilege of all – that of coming boldly to the throne of grace that we
may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need (Heb. 4:16).

<P>Oh, bless our God, you peoples! And make the voice of His praise to
be heard, Who keeps our souls among the living, And does not allow our
feet to be moved. Our God has tested us; refined us as silver; brought
us into the net; laid affliction on our backs and caused men to ride over
our heads. We went through fire and through water, but He has brought us
out to know more of the riches of Christ (Psa. 66:8-12). "Therefore by
Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the
fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name" (Heb. 13:15).

<P>Blessed be God, Who has not turned away our prayers, Nor His mercy from
us!&nbsp;
