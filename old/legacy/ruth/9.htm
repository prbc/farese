<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS FACE (GEN. 32:9-31)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>The Lord commands us to "seek His face." Oh that all our hearts would
answer as David's. "Thy face, Lord will I seek" (Psa. 27:8).&nbsp;

<P>What does this mean? It means that God desires all men and women to
come into a personal relationship and fellowship with Him. It is to have
communion with the living God.&nbsp;

<P>How is this begun and how does it continue? By prayer, seeking grace
from the only one that can enable us to see God and live, the Lord Jesus
Christ. We see God and His glory in the face of Jesus Christ (II Cor. 4:6).
He is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). It is He that must give
us repentance and forgiveness of sins or we will never see God face to
face (Acts 11:18). Our sins hide His face from us (Isa. 59:2). This is
why David says in Psa. 27:9, "Hide not thy face from me" and "Make thy
face to shine upon thy servant: Save me for thy mercies' sake" in Psa.
31:16. He wants the "Sun of Righteousness" to warm and enliven, not only
his outward being, but his inward soul -- his heart -- that he might have
a sense of God's favor and know that He is pleased with his manner of life,
or heal him if He isn't (Mal. 4:2).&nbsp;

<P>Do you desire to speak with God face to face and behold more of His
glory as Moses did (Ex. 33:11,18)? Then you must not be surprised if God
is putting you into fiery trials as He did with Jacob. He is only keeping
His promise to do you good and to sanctify you, body, soul and spirit (I
Th. 5:23-24). He is conforming you to His image. He is refining His gold
and silver (Mal. 3:3). The refiner only keeps the metal in the fire until
he can see his face in it. Then he knows that all the impurities are burned
out.&nbsp;

<P>We must learn to thank God in everything, because all things are for
our sakes if we are His people (II Cor. 4:15).&nbsp;

<P>After Jacob's meeting with God he was humbled, wounded, healed, marked
and given a new name -- Israel. God will give us that same name in the
same way because now we are "the Israel of God" (Gal. 6:16).&nbsp;

<P>We will be renewed day by day, and our afflictions will seem light if
we with open face (with sin repented of and forgiven) behold as in a glass
the glory of the Lord (II Cor. 3:18, 4:15-18).&nbsp;

<P>Oh Lord, make Thy face to shine upon Thy servants lest we die and be
found unfruitful.&nbsp;</TD>
