<p>  "Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me!  For my soul trusts in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, Until these calamities have passed by."

<p>  Oh, the sweetness of His love and care, and the safety of His protection. He describes it all by using the word - WINGS.

<p>  Are in greet need?  Fear not, He walks on the wings of the wind; the clouds are His chariot (Psa. 104:3).  He will come and meet your need just when the time is right; nothing, and no one, can prevent the wind from blowing whenever and wherever, it pleases.  

<p>  Do you need love and care? He will gently, and lovingly, gather you under His wings where it is so warm and safe; so comfortable and full of a mother's love (Matt. 23:37).

<p>  Do you need protection from something, or someone, that would do you harm, or even kill you? Fear not.  He is the Lord of the wing.  In vain does our enemy put out his net (Prov. 1:17).  You are safe; you are loved; you are cared for.  No wonder the Psalmist said, "You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance (32:7)

<p>  When all is dark and it looks like rain, run into this shelter (Psa. 61:4).  It will not only keep you safe and dry, but you will also find a reward waiting there for you from the Lord God of Israel (Ruth 2:12). 

<p>  Oh, let us think on these things, and may our meditation be sweet to Him who has lowered Himself so greatly as to even describe Himself as a lowly hen.  May we have eyes to see how truly wonderful our Savior is, and how blessed we all are to be just His!!!

<p>  Let us rejoice continually in the shadow of His wings because He has been our help (Psa. 63:7).

<p>  Dear reader, you who still do not know the reality of this "hiding place" -  may the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings for you today, so that you may fly to Him (Mal. 4:2).
