<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS BATTLE (2 CHRONICLES 20:15)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>Dear Christian, does the battle against all your spiritual enemies (sin,
self, world, devil) seem too much for you? Perhaps you are a new "recruit"
in this "army" and you never thought, or heard, that this would be a fight
to the finish. No one told you that you must "endure hardship as a good
soldier of Jesus Christ" (II Tim. 2:3).&nbsp;

<P>Take courage, the major battle has been won. We are more than conquerors
through Him that loved us (Rom. 8:37).&nbsp;

<P>You see, we never had a chance of winning this battle, this battle for
life. We were slaves to sin, without strength, without will to change,
without desire to overcome. Our nature was at enmity against God. We were
dead in sins. What can a dead man do (Jn. 8:34, Rom.5:6, Jn. 5:40, Rom.
8:7, Eph, 2:1)?&nbsp;

<P>But God in great mercy sent His Son, a Man of war, to fight for us (Ex.
15:3). His death on the cross and resurrection from the grave was the death
of death. He made an end of sin and brought in everlasting righteousness
(Dan. 9:24).&nbsp;

<P>Now we are commanded to "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of
eternal life" (I Tim. 6:12). We don't fight for life, but because we have
life (Jn. 5:24). Eternal life is a gift of God, purchased by the life and
death of the Lord. He was the ransom to buy us back (Isa. 35:10). He gives
life freely now to all that ask that Him (Eph. 2:8-9, Rev. 22:17).&nbsp;

<P>This fight of faith will only be won though, if we follow the rules
for victory in Ephesians 6:10-18. Let me show you the battle plan that
will guarantee victory - more than victory - great riches gained.&nbsp;

<P>If you will read chapter 20 of II Chronicles, verses 1-30, you will
see the perfect plan for victory.&nbsp;

<P>Great armies of men had come to fight against God's people and Jehoshaphat
feared, sought the Lord in prayer, and proclaimed a fast (3). He has put
on the shield of faith. He believes and knows, that God is the Sovereign
Ruler over heaven and earth, and has all power to do whatever He pleases
(6). He has his feet shod with the gospel (7). This God is his God and
has promised him an inheritance. He walks now with courage and ease over
the difficult places. He has put on the breastplate of righteousness. He
now cries out to his God in his affliction knowing that He will hear and
help. He is now his Friend (7-9). He has put on the helmet of salvation.
He has an assured hope. Now with his loins girded with the truth, he pulls
out the sword that will kill all his enemies, the word of God, and says,
"O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power against this
great multitude that is coming against us: nor do we know what to do, but
our eyes are upon You (12). He knows that apart from his God he is powerless
to win any battle, so he prays according to the word of God (John 15:5).&nbsp;

<P>God's answer to him is our answer also in time of need. "Thus says the
Lord to you: "Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude,
for the battle is not yours, but God's. Tomorrow go down against them.
You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still
and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you. Do not fear or be dismayed;
tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is with you" (II Ch. 20:15-17).&nbsp;

<P>We do not need to fight in the battle for life, but we must fight in
the battle against sin. We must mortify (destroy the strength of) the deeds
of the body with the help of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:13).&nbsp;

<P>So let us rise up early each morning, put on our armor, sharpen our
weapons by reading the word of God and prayer and "go against them, for
the Lord will be with us." Instead of this time, this place, becoming a
Valley of Death to us, it will be a Valley of Blessing. We will call it
the Valley of Berachah because there our God will make us to rejoice over
our "enemies" and we will be filled with joy, blessing the name of the
Lord because He has fought with us and for us, and we have gathered precious
spiritual riches (25-30). We will say with David, "Blessed be the Lord
my strength, which teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: My
goodness, and my fortress: my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield,
and He in whom I trust" ( Psa. 144:1-2).</TD>
