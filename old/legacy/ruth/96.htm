<center><b><font size=+2>HIS WEEDING</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All gardens have weeds and a good gardener
must be always looking for them so that his plants and trees will grow
well.&nbsp; The area around plants and trees must be kept clear of weeds
to ensure that their feeding roots do not have to compete for water and
nutrients.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beware of the weeds; they choke the plants
(Mk. 4:19).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two ways to control or kill the weeds.&nbsp;
We can be fellow laborers with our Gardener, pulling them up as He has
instructed us through the Spirit and as soon as we see them (Rom. 8:13,
I Cor. 3:9), or we can do nothing, and wait for our Gardener to kill them
for us (Heb. 12:11).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first way takes the work of prayer and
meditation, and at times doesn't seem to be successful.&nbsp; The second
way is always successful.&nbsp; It may be very painful, but it works for
our good, and produces the peaceable fruit of righteousness (Heb. 12:11).
If we are not bearing this fruit, our master Gardener may have to cut some
of us back once in a while, even to the ground, with nothing left but a
stump, if we have neglected our weeding.&nbsp; But if our root is still
good, we will grow again to His glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, if you feel as though you are
being "overworked" (chastised), as some plants (children) do, make sure
that you are working to bear the fruit that is most precious to the Lord
- love - His love - keeping yourself in the love of God (Jude 21).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The form or shape of the tree is not as important
to the gardener as its fruit.&nbsp; Love is the one thing necessary (I
Cor. 16:22), love for God, as well as man (I Jn. 3:10,14).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Gardener must produce this fruit in us
or we shall die.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask, seek, and knock, and don't stop until
you know that you have it (Matt. 7:7).&nbsp; "Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them" (Matt. 7:20).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
