<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS WELL&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>There was a well called Beer-la-hai-roi that was between Kadesh and
Bered (Gen. 16:14). The name means "the well of Him that lives and sees
me" -- sees me in my affliction. Though this well may not still be there
after so many thousands of years, it is still there, spiritually. In fact,
it is everywhere we are. It is one of the wells of salvation that we must
drink from if we are to be saved. May we drink from it with joy (Isa.12:3).&nbsp;

<P>The living God, the God that knows and sees all, the God that we see
in the face of Jesus Christ, has dug this well with His own hands so that
He could say to all, "And the Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!' And let
him who hears say, 'Come!' And let him that who thirsts come. Whoever desires,
let him take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17).&nbsp;

<P>Look at the tools that He used to dig this well.&nbsp;

<P>One is called LOVE -- love so strong that it is stronger them death
(S.O.S. 8:6). Love so fervent that many waters cannot quench it (S.O.S.
8:7), love so rich that if a man give all the wealth of his house for this
love, it would be utterly despised (S.O.S. 8:7). See its glory as the Lord
cries out for His murderers, "Father forgive them, for they know not what
they do" (Lk. 23:34).&nbsp;

<P>Here is another tool -- it is called FAITH: faith so true, so pure,
so holy that it is ready to do the work at any price, at any cost to self.&nbsp;

<P>See the beauty of this tool as the Lord cries from the cross, "My God,
My God, why have You forsaken me" (Mk.15:34)? Though God has forsaken Him,
He is still His God. His faith never changes; it never lessens, though
He kill Him. It is because this tool never failed that we live. Paul says,
"I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless, I live: yet not I, but Christ
lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith
of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me" (Gal. 2:20).&nbsp;

<P>Here is another tool -- it is called PRAYER. This is the tool by which
He strengthens Himself for the work. Look at Him as He works and prays.
Oh, how He sweats. Men that work hard to earn a living, sweat. But this
"Man" sweats blood, for you see this Man is working for life -- eternal
life -- for the life of His tender plants. He is preparing the ground well
so that His plants will live. He waters the ground with His blood because
life is in the blood and there is no remission of sin without it (Lev.
17:11, Heb. 9:22). His plants are sure to live now because His blood is
the blood of God (Acts 20:28).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, look deeply into this dark and deep well, and drink from it daily,
and you will find joy for all your sorrows, strength for all your weakness,
peace for all your fears, hope for all your tomorrows, grace for all your
needs, and love everlasting.&nbsp;
