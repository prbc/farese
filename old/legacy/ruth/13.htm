<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS THOUGHTS (Ps. 40:17)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>"But I am poor and needy: yet the Lord thinketh upon me." Though no
man, no friend, no relative, thinks upon us, or cares for us, the Lord
thinks upon us. Even if friends and loved ones think upon us and about
us, it is impossible for them to think about us the majority of the time
because of the necessities of life. They must sleep and they must work.
Not so with our God. He who keeps us never slumbers or sleeps (Ps. 121:4).
He is always mindful of us.&nbsp;

<P>Think upon the blessedness of this truth. Though loved ones may think
about us, they don't always know our needs or our dangers. Our God knows
them all, and will always meet all our needs (Phil. 4:19). He is the God
of all grace: all things are under His control. All power in heaven and
earth is Christ's (Matt. 28:18).&nbsp;

<P>Dear Christian -- He thinks upon you.&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you before the cross.&nbsp;

<P>In the garden of Gethsemane His soul was exceedingly sorrowful even
unto death as He thought of you, and the price He was going to have to
pay for your sins. He was in agony and His sweat was as it were great drops
of blood falling down to the ground (Luke 22:44).&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you as He prayed, before Judas came to betray Him, saying,
"Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me,
that they may be one, as we are" ( Jn. 17:11). "Keep them from the evil."
(Jn. 17:15). "Sanctify them through thy truth." (Jn. 17:17). "Father, I
will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that
they may behold my glory" (Jn. 17:24).&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you on the cross.&nbsp;

<P>He prayed, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do" (Luke
23:34).&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you as His blood poured out from the nails in His hands
and feet, from His back opened by the whip, and from His head as the crown
of thorns dug into His scalp.&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you as they stripped Him naked and cast lots for His garments
so that you could be clothed with His righteousness because He loved you
and gave Himself for you (Gal. 2:20).&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you after the cross.&nbsp;

<P>As He sits on the throne of God in heaven, He is praying for you that
you might be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). You are never out of His
mind.&nbsp;

<P>He thought of you and loved you even before you were born, and will
love you until the end of time -- throughout eternity.&nbsp;

<P>May He not tarry in meeting your need. But if He does, know that it
is because He will be gracious to you and have mercy upon you. He knows
the right time for all things. Blessed are all those that wait for Him
(Isa. 30:18). Is it any wonder that David says in Psa. 139:17, "How precious
also are the thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!"&nbsp;

<P>May we truly say the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
