<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS SHIELD (Mk. 15:34)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>The Lord's shield was His God. He had faith in Him. Even though He was
dying, He was still HIS GOD. He trusted in His word, His promises, and
His faithfulness to His promises. "He is a shield to all who trust in Him"
(Psa. 18:30).&nbsp;

<P>Because He did, nothing could kill Him. He rose from the grave victorious,
to live forevermore.&nbsp;

<P>Job had this kind of faith, and because he did, he could say after losing
all his possessions, all his children, and then struck with a deadly disease,
"though He slay me, yet will I trust Him -- He also shall be my salvation"
(Job 13:15-16). "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand
at last on the earth; and after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that
in my flesh I shall see God; whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall
behold, and not another" (Job 19:25-27).&nbsp;

<P>We must have THIS SHIELD OF FAITH, the faith that the Lord gives, HIS
FAITH, that enables a person to trust in Him, regardless of the terrible
circumstances in their lives (Gal. 2:20, Phil. 1:29).&nbsp;

<P>The scripture says, "Above all, taking the shield of faith with which
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO QUENCH ALL the fiery darts of the wicked one" (Eph.
6:16).&nbsp;

<P>There were two kinds of shields in biblical times. One was a large oblong
door-like shield, four feet long and two feet wide which could cover the
whole body. This is the one that is meant in Eph. 6:16. Then there was
a small round shield called a buckler which was used for close combat.
This was worn on the left arm. These shields were made of metal, and sometimes
of gold. The larger ones were also made of wood covered with leather. Solomon
made his shields of gold. This speaks of great riches, authority, and power
(I Kgs. 10:17).&nbsp;

<P>When David captured his enemies, he would bring back their golden shields
as memorials to the power and grace of His God to him, in giving him so
many victories over his enemies and God's. He trusted in the Lord as his
buckler and shield (II Sam. 8:7, 22:31, 36).&nbsp;

<P>The Lord has planted us in this land with all His heart and with all
His soul, and He rejoices over us continually to do us good (Jer. 32:39-41).
Let us not grieve Him with our sorrow and unbelief so that He will have
to say to us, as David said at the death of Saul and Jonathan, "The beauty
of Israel is slain. How the mighty have fallen." -- all because of the
unbelief of Saul (II Sam. 1:19,21).&nbsp;

<P>Let us begin to look more and more at all the painful things in our
lives as opportunities to "bring home" the golden shields of our greatest
enemies, winning them as the Lord won His.&nbsp;

<P>We are the Lord's bride. May His description of our beauty be proven
true in our lives. He says, "Your neck is like the tower of David, built
for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
men" (S.O.S. 4:4).&nbsp;

<P>The tower of David was a tower made of white marble which stood on a
summit of Zion. It was adorned with the shields and arms of the mighty
that he had conquered, and was a beautiful sight to behold. Its ruins can
still be seen.&nbsp;

<P>May you and I bring this truth to mind, now, as we fight our daily fight
of faith, and know that each time, when by His grace and power we bring
home another golden shield, we will be glorifying our Lord and shall hear
Him say, "Behold, you are fair, my love! Behold, you are fair!" (S.O.S.
4:1)&nbsp;
