<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every
moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day" (Isa. 27:3).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder His garden shall blossom and bud
and fill the face of the world with fruit.&nbsp; He, Himself, will cause
them to take root (Isa. 27:6).&nbsp; He does this by working in them to
will and to do (Phil. 2:13).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plant is 90% water.&nbsp; Water is the essential
element of cell sap and is vital for photosynthesis (the complex means
by which carbon dioxide and water are converted into living plant tissue
with the aid of radiant energy, especially light).&nbsp; Food energy is
gathered by the leaves from the light and transferred down to feed the
roots.&nbsp; Roots store some of the nutrients generated by the leaves
and make chemical compounds that help regulate the growth.&nbsp; The life
and health of a plant though, depends upon a good water supply to keep
this process working well.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a picture of the spiritual life of
the Lord's garden.&nbsp; The Lord is the light (Jn. 8:12); without it nothing
could live or survive.&nbsp; Water is the essential element to make the
plant come into being.&nbsp; Respiration, germination, development of roots,
shoots, leaves, flowers, and fruit all depend upon a good water supply.&nbsp;
Only the Lord has the living water that can produce life and sustain it,
and He invites all to come to this well of living water (Isa. 55:1-3).&nbsp;
He says, "I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water
of life freely" (Rev. 21:6).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not an escape from hell that He focuses
on, but LIFE, HIS LIFE.&nbsp; He wants all to come to HIM.&nbsp; GOD'S
GIFT IS HIS OWN LIFE, not just the life of enjoyment; the birds and beasts
have that.&nbsp; God wants to give people (and He does give to His people,
His plants) HIS LIFE, HIS PERFECT HAPPINESS, not just joy, but HIS JOY.&nbsp;
We must have HIS MIND, and HIS CHARACTER, and this is what we must continually
ask for if we are to live and grow up into Him (Rom. 12:2, I Cor. 2:16,
Eph. 4:15, Phil. 2:5).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that prevents us from being
and growing like this is our pride, self-righteousness, and unbelief.&nbsp;
We refuse to believe the freeness of His "unspeakable gift."&nbsp; We want
to bring something - our prayers, our tears, our feelings, our faith, our
will, our works, to buy His favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, don't let this be your ruin.&nbsp; This
is the death of many hopeful plants. Let us always remember that we are
nothing but "dust and ashes" - HIS ashes, precious in His sight (Gen.3:19,
18:27, Psa. 103:13-14).&nbsp; He must water us if we are to live and grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us drink deeply from this precious fountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
