<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS HELMET&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>In biblical days, the helmet was a vital piece of armor. Some were made
of metal and had a beautiful crest flowing out from the top of them. The
helmet and the shield were both very necessary because they protected the
most vital parts of the body. A wound to the head or heart could mean certain
death.&nbsp;

<P>The Lord's helmet was one of a kind. He made it Himself from His own
flesh and blood ripped apart on the cross (Heb. 10:19-20). His helmet is
always flourishing as a crown on His head (Rev. 19:12). He made this helmet
of salvation for us, and we must put it on, and keep it on, if we are to
be saved (Eph. 6:17).&nbsp;

<P>1 Th. 5:8 tells us that it is a helmet of hope. It is not a "one-time
decision." It is a continual hope to the end of life on earth (I Pet. 1:13).
We must wear this helmet until God in His mercy takes it off and replaces
it with a crown of glory (I Pet. 5:4).&nbsp;

<P>We must strengthen this hope day by day. If we don't, we will find ourselves
entering into sin - sin which could be fatal, and would be, if the Lord
didn't pray for us and keep us (Lk. 22:32; Jn. 17:12, 1 Pet. 1:5).&nbsp;

<P>Faith and hope stand together. If our helmet can be pierced with one
of Satan's fiery darts, our shield of faith will fall with it. Peter learned
this when the soldiers took the Lord away to crucify Him. He denied the
Lord three times because what he saw looked like the end of his hope (Mk.
14:66-72).&nbsp;

<P>Let us be thankful to God for His great gift, and be diligent to strengthen
our hope giving glory to God. We can do this by:&nbsp;

<P>1. Studying the word of God in order to know the promises of God. Augustine
said, "Garrisons are not easily found in time of war if they are not sought
out in time of peace." It is the promises of God that produce patience
and comfort so that we might have hope (Rom. 15:4).&nbsp;

<P>2. Keeping a clear conscience. Living godly in this present world, and
looking for that blessed hope, are joined together (Tit. 2:12-13).&nbsp;

<P>3. Asking God daily for a stronger hope (Rom. 15:13).&nbsp;

<P>4. Seeking to increase our love for God (Jude 21).&nbsp;

<P>5. Exercising our hope according to God's promises, remembering how
great and almighty our God is (Jer. 32:27).&nbsp;

<P>6. Remembering past mercies. Experience works hope (Rom. 5:3-5). This
is what enabled David to overcome Goliath (I Sam. 17:37).&nbsp;

<P>Oh Lord, You are our hope, and because You are, we are a people greatly
blessed (Jer. 17:7-8),&nbsp;

<P>May You now, as the God of hope, fill us with all joy and peace in believing,
that we may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:13).&nbsp;
