<center><b><font size=+2>HIS DYING</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For when we were yet without strength, in
due time Christ died for the ungodly.&nbsp; For scarcely for a righteous
man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare
to die, But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:6-8).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Lord must die that we might live, so
we must die; die to ourselves, die to the wanting of our own will done,
instead of His, if we want to bear fruit to His glory.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is he that "loses his life" that finds it
(Matt. 10:39). This is a truth of such vital importance that the Lord mentions
it in every gospel, and twice in Matthew.&nbsp; It is the divine, as well
as the natural law of all seed.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is because those that are His have crucified
the flesh with the affections and lusts that the Lord calls some of the
plants in His garden - frankincense, myrrh, and aloes (Gal. 5:24).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankincense was used for fumigation at sacrifices.&nbsp;
Myrrh was used for anointing dead bodies.&nbsp; It was preservative and
a disinfectant.&nbsp; They were all sweet smelling plants though, and were
used to make a holy anointing oil and a perfume to be used in the tabernacle
(Ex. 30:22-38).&nbsp; They were typical of the many graces of the Lord.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aloe had another characteristic though.&nbsp;
It was, and is, a very special plant.&nbsp; It blooms but once in its lifetime.&nbsp;
When it does, it breaks into a thousand flowers, and as each one drops
off, it takes root and becomes a new plant.&nbsp; The old plant then dies
but in dying it brings forth a thousand lives.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, you are a sweet-savor to your
Lord.&nbsp; He enwrapped you around His dead body to sweeten His death
(Jn. 19:38-40).&nbsp; He has shown you, and all of us, that it is possible
to see sorrow in the cup, and yet refuse to give it up; to drink it all
to the death.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us be His aloe tree.&nbsp; Let us live
to die; to give life to others by the working of His&nbsp;
<br>Spirit in us and through us, to sweeten their dead souls so that they
may be another one of His aloe trees.&nbsp; Let us follow Him.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God help us to do it!
