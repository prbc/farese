<center><font size=+2>THE MASTER GARDENER</font>
<br>By R. T. Holmes</center>

<p>"I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman" (Jn. 15:1).
<p>All good gardeners must have a plan if they are going to have a beautiful,
flourishing garden; and so it was with our God.
<p>Many, many, years ago God planted a garden in Eden, and put man in it
to dress it and keep it (Gen. 2:8, 15).&nbsp;&nbsp; But man sinned by disobeying
God and became a sinner.&nbsp; Because he did, God cursed the ground for
his sake, and thorns and thistles sprung up.
<p>The Lord God then drove the man out from the garden of Eden to till
the ground from which he was taken (Gen. 3:17-19, 23).
<p>But the Lord God was full of mercy and love for His creation and had
planned for another garden, His garden, and He determined to be the Master
Gardener.&nbsp; This garden would be more useful, more beautiful, and more
glorious than any other because He would do all the work, Himself, to make
it a place of great delight, and pleasure; a place where He could eat the
pleasant fruits that grew there, and smell the sweet fragrance.&nbsp; It
would be a place that would glorify Him (S.O.S. 4:12-16).
<p>Because the ground was now cursed, hard, and full of thorns and thistles,
unable to grow anything useful or beautiful, God asked His Son, His only
Son, if He would be willing to cultivate this ground, this soil, so that
the plants that He had chosen could, and would grow, and bear precious
fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The Son agreed wholeheartedly, even though His Father chose a site in
which to plant His plants that would cause His Son much agonizing labor,
and would finally kill him (Lk. 22:44, 23:46).&nbsp; Yet His Son delighted
to do His will because He loved His Father, and loved His plants; He had
given them to Him to take care of (Psa. 40:8, Jn. 17:6, 9-10).
<p>Oh, let us plant much "lettuce" in the Lord's garden for we are workers
together with Him (II Cor. 6:1).
<p>"Let us" arm ourselves likewise with the same mind; for he that has
suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin. "Let us" love one another, for
love is of God: and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God (I
Pet. 4:1, I Jn. 4:7).
<p>May we no longer live the rest of our time in the flesh to the lusts
of men, but to the will of God showing ourselves to be the plants of His
planting (Psa. 92:13-14, I Pet. 4:2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
