<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS CARE (I Peter 5:7)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>What a wonderful verse this is. "Casting all your care upon him; for
he careth for you." If only we would believe it, and obey it, we would
find ourselves free from care and worry and have perfect peace.&nbsp;

<P>Let me attempt by God's grace to open up for you "His care." May you
have a taste of this perfect peace.&nbsp;

<P>God gives an example of His care for his people by speaking of himself
as an eagle. He says in Ex. 19:4, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptian,
and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself."&nbsp;

<P>The eagle carries her eaglets on her wings high in the air so no enemy
can harm them without first killing her.&nbsp;

<P>In the Old Testament it was a picture of God saving his people by great
strength and power from the Egyptians that were going to kill them. He
killed them.&nbsp;

<P>In the New Testament it is a picture of the Lord bringing His people
to Himself by great strength and power, but in order to do it He had to
allow Himself to the killed. In doing so though, he put His "little ones"
in the cleft of the Rock where no harm could ever reach them again. Their
"nest" is so high up that none can reach it (Job 39:27-30).&nbsp;

<P>Here is where the eagle teaches her eaglets how to improve their eyesight,
to fly, and to hunt for food. She places her eaglets facing into the sun.
This strengthens their eyes so that they are enabled to see very far off.
She then teaches them to fly. At first they don't want to leave the nest,
so she stirs them up and flutters over them, showing them how to use their
wings. Then she takes them out and lets them fly upon her wings until they
can fly alone. When they get weak she swoops down under them and catches
them on her wings so that they won't be dashed to pieces on the rocks.
She supports them until they learn to fly on their own (Deut. 32:11). When
they are hungry, she seeks her prey to feed them. She preys upon living
animals which she seizes and tears to pieces, and then carries her prey
to them to suck up the blood.&nbsp;

<P>Let us learn how much our Lord cares for us from these word pictures.&nbsp;

<P>He has brought us to himself by his goodness. Ps. 103:5 says, "Who satisfieth
thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's."&nbsp;

<P>The eagle is very vigorous and lives long. The Lord has brought us to
life and given us eternal life. We will be forever "young." He has taught
us to look at the "Sun of Righteousness" to enable us to see far off --
even to see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. He is teaching
us now to fly -- to mount up with wings as eagles. May we learn our lessons
quickly (Isa. 40:31).&nbsp;

<P>The eagle learns to face the brutal storms of life head-on. When he
sees the sky turning black and the lightning flashing, he sits perfectly
still watching the storm. ("Be still and know that I am God" Ps. 46:10.)
He never moves until he begins to feel the strong wind, and then with a
scream, he swings his breast to the storm and uses the storm to mount up
on high, borne upward by it and upon it.&nbsp;

<P>This is what God would have us to do; to be more than conquerors, turning
the evil, the heartbreak, the sorrow, the pain, into a chariot to carry
us up to Him, to find our life in Him and not in earthly things. If we
are to live we must eat the food that our "Mother" brings to us. Our "Eagle"
brings Himself, and we must eat His flesh and drink His blood or we shall
not live (Jn. 6:53-58). This does not mean that we should actually eat
it. The Lord made this very clear to the people to whom He spoke that didn't
have any true spiritual understanding of His words. He said to them, "It
is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that
I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (Jn.6:63). His words
must be read, studied, meditated upon, and obeyed, praying always to Him
for spiritual understanding without which we shall never know them as "food"
and "drink" (I Cor. 2:14). We must "as newborn babes, desire the sincere
milk of the word, that we may grow thereby" (I Pet. 2:2). Only then will
His life become our life.&nbsp;

<P>But fear not "little eaglets." The Lord has given you the wings of a
great eagle. You are in the wilderness now, in the place which He has purposed
for you. You will be nourished there and the serpent will not harm you
(Rev. 12:14). The Lord shall cover you there with His feathers and under
His wings shall you trust (Psa. 91:4). You will live to see all your enemies
slain in the last day (Job 39:30, Matt. 24:28). Our Lord overcame sin,
the world and the devil, and His victory is ours.&nbsp;

<P>Oh Lord, hide us under the shadow of Your wings until You come (Psa.
17:8).</TD>
