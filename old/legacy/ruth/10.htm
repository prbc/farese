<FONT SIZE=5> HIS BEING ALONE (JOHN 16:32) </FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4> <I> By Ruth Holmes </I></FONT></CENTER>
<p>
I write this for you who live alone, or are alone most of the time.  It can be a very sad and trying time.  It doesn't matter if we are young or old.  Each age has its heartaches and difficulties.  For some, being alone is more difficult than for others.  If you are alone and sick, in constant pain, or disabled, your being alone is the most trying.  I pray that what I may write will meet a need in your life by God's grace.
<p>
What we need most when we are alone is a friend, a lover, or a husband (or a wife).  These are relationships that are very sweet and our hearts long for such a person.  The sad part is that many are sad all their lives because they have not found that "one" that can meet their need.  The tragedy is that they are constantly looking in the wrong place.
<p>
There is only one person that can meet all our needs and that "One" is God.  If we are His people, He has been faithful and called us unto the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (I Cor. 1:9).  It is because of His fellowship that we shall never be alone again.
<p>
Our fellowship with God, the Father, is only made possible because of His fellowship with God the Son.  William Hendriksen translates John 1:1 like this; "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was face to face with God."  It is because the Father and His Son have been in perfect fellowship from all eternity that we can enjoy this same blessed fellowship regardless of our circumstances.  As John, I write this that your joy may be full  (1 Jn.1:1-4).  He has become our Friend, our Lover and our Husband.  Is HE not enough?
<p>
When Jacob met Esau after seeing God face to face, Esau wanted Jacob to keep the present that he brought him, but Jacob insisted that he take it and said, "I have enough"  (Gen. 33:11).  His "enough" in the Hebrew literally means ALL, not just enough.  We have the same as Christians.  "For all things are yours" (1 Cor. 3:21).  Oh that this truth would come in power to all those that are still not content, not satisfied, not joyful, not at peace being alone.
<p>
When the Lord was left alone on the cross, dying for us, to cover over the face of God so that he could look on us face to face, he told his disciples that he would not be alone because the Father was with him.  He died that we might have his peace, his joy, his fellowship in the worst of circumstances (Jn.16:32-33).  Please don't let it be meaningless to your life.
<p>
His blessing may seem to be a very painful and wounding experience to you right now, as it was to Jacob, but be assured that your "night" will end as Jacob's did if you are God's child.  Hold on to Christ, wrestle with him in prayer and don't let him go until He has blessed you with a new vision of His loveliness which will renew your love and obedience to Him.  He is a friend that loves at all times (Prov. 17:17).  Enjoy His love and you will see your loneliness fade out of sight.
<p>
For you that are really alone, without God, without His forgiveness, without His love, and without His fellowship, I would encourage you to seek the Lord.  Pray that He would reveal your need and Himself to you.  He has come that you also may have fellowship with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.  Here is a relationship of love and enjoyment that surpasses all others.  May it be yours.
