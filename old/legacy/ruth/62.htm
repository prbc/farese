<P>"Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me" (Psa. 23:4).

<P>Every shepherd carried a rod and a staff. The rod was made of a young
sapling, carved and whittled down, shaped to fit the shepherd’s hand exactly.
The rod was used against anything that would harm or attack. Many hours
were spent practicing how to throw it so that it would always hit the mark.
It was the shepherd’s main weapon of defense for both himself and his sheep.

<P>The rod was in fact an extension of the owner’s own right arm. It stood
as a symbol of his strength, power, and authority in any serious situation.
It was also used to discipline and correct any wayward sheep. If they were
straying from the path, he would throw the rod at them to get their attention.

<P>The rod speaks of God’s word - the scriptures. It is what the Lord threw
at Satan when He was in the wilderness to make him run away for awhile
(Matt. 4:11).

<P>The rod brings comfort because the Lord uses it in our lives not only
to chase away our enemies for a little while, but to actually kill them.
Our sins are put to death by the rod and His staff - the Holy Spirit (Rom.
8:13).

<P>The shepherd also uses the rod as his sheep enter the narrow gate (Matt.
7:13-14). He uses it to count his sheep to make sure none have strayed
away. As they come through the gate he also uses the rod to lift up, and
look under, the wool, parting it to see if there is any disease, wounds,
or defects. He runs his hands over their bodies then to feel for any sign
of trouble. This is a very searching process and a comfort to the sheep
as only in this way could the hidden problems be seen and known.

<P>Oh, that we might always see the rod as a comfort to us and not despise
our Father, as some children do if they think he is disciplining them too
severely (Heb. 12:5-6). It gives assurance to us that we are His well-loved
children; He cannot, He will not, let us go to hell (Prov. 23:13-14, Heb.
12:5-11).&nbsp;

<P>Let us pray as David did. "Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try
me, and know my anxieties: And see if there is any wicked way in me, And
lead me in the way everlasting" (Psa. 139:23-24). In this way we will be
working with our Shepherd to accomplish His good purpose for us (I Cor.
11:31-32, Phil. 2:12-13, II Jn. 8, Jude 20-21). This will bring joy to
His heart.&nbsp;
