<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>His Crown (Rev. 14:14)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>When we read the word "crown" we tend to think of something that kings
and queens wear. But the word has a deeper meaning; it is a word that signifies
completeness. A crown is that which completes the wedding attire, or completes
the attire of a king or queen when they become that. It speaks of authority
and power. In athletic games it speaks of success or victory.

<P>The Hebrew word translated as "spouse" in S.O.S. 4:8-12 means "a crowned
one", derived from a root signifying "to make perfect."&nbsp;

<P>Prov. 12:4 says, "A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband." She is
his glory as we are the glory of our Lord (I Cor. 11:7, II Cor 8:23). This
is an amazing statement but this is what the scripture says. As Christ
is a diadem of beauty and a crown of glory unto His people, we, His people
(Zion), are a crown of glory and a royal diadem unto the Lord (Isa. 28:5,
62:3).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, see the beauty and glory that His bride sees in her Lord as she
says, "His head is as the most fine gold" (S.O.S. 5:11). This is the most
choice, pure, and solid gold, gold very carefully refined. His head is
His government, authority, and kingdom. The gold speaks of glory and duration.
This is the crown of pure gold that is on His head (Rev. 14:14).&nbsp;

<P>Now see the glory, the honor, and the privilege that His church, His
people, His bride has as she crowns Him on the day of His wedding, the
day of the gladness of His heart (S.O.S. 3:11). She is called "His mother"
because in Eastern countries it was the custom for the mother to crown
the bridegroom. She symbolizes the human race from which He came as the
Son of man. The Lord showed His preference, though, to His "spiritual mother"
in Matt. 12:48-50 instead of His earthly mother.&nbsp;

<P>As we follow the Lord here on earth the only crown we may see, or feel,
is a crown of thorns like that which pierced the head of our blessed Savior.
But we have a more glorious crown awaiting us – A CROWN OF LIFE. The Lord
says, "Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer –
be faithful until death and I will give you a crown of life," real life,
eternal life, a life of love, joy, and peace; a life without sickness and
disease, without weariness and dullness, without pain and misery; a life
without emptiness of heart and soul; a life of fullness of pleasure; a
life of <U>boundless</U>, <U>limitless</U>, <U>infinite</U> <U>love</U>
(Rev. 2:10).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, let us endure temptations, afflictions, and the hardness of life
with the help of the Holy Spirit (Jas. 1:12, II Tim. 2:3, 4:5). The Lord
is only making up His jewels, fitting and setting them in the crown that
we will one day present to Him on our wedding day. He is making His crown
to flourish – to blossom as the original word means – by giving us streams
in the desert of our life (Psa. 132:18). He will crown the year (all our
years) with His goodness(Psa. 65:11).

<P>May our heartfelt prayer be the same as that of Julian of Norwich who
lived from 1342 - 1413 when poverty, plagues, wars and despotic kings ravaged
Europe. She said, "Father help me to respond to Your call of love by following
in the way of Jesus – though darkness and the world, and my own soul’s
cowardice, tempt me to turn back. Lead me deeper into the humility and
love that mark all Your true children. Be my goal – my life – and my soul’s
crown."</TD>
