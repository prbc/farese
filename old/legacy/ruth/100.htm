<center><b><font size=+1>HIS HEDGE</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse,
a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (S.O.S. 4:12).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord has a garden that is enclosed so that
no real harm shall ever come to His plants.&nbsp; No foxes will get in
to spoil the vines; no weeds will choke the plants; He will keep His garden
night and day (S.O.S. 2:15, 4:12, Isa. 27:3).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a hedge, a wall, so high and so strong
that nothing can penetrate it except by the permission of our Gardener
for our good (Job l:9-12).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has shut His people in; they are a spring
shut up, a fountain sealed.&nbsp; If any try to hurt His plants they will
bring great suffering upon themselves and their families (Gen. 20:2-7,
II Th. 1:6).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps, dear Christian, you feel "shut
in" because you are weak and sickly, disabled, or old, unable to do much.&nbsp;
Jeremiah felt the same way; he felt hedged in, chained to an unbearable
situation, beating his head against a stone wall, not knowing what path
to take, feeling as though God had forsaken him. His hope perished, yet
this was the will of God for him; the way in which he was to serve and
glorify God (Lam. 3:7-18).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 37:23 says, "The steps of a good man
are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way."&nbsp; George Mueller
said, "And the stops also."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have learned to walk with the Lord, now
we must learn to wait for the Lord (Psa. 40:1).&nbsp; We must learn to
stand still, quietly waiting, not losing heart or hope; submitting to the
will of God, confident and rejoicing in Him, glorifying, honoring, and
serving Him with praise and thanksgiving; feeding Him with the fruit of
our lips that He has created (Isa. 57:19). We will, we can, if we remember,
as Jeremiah did, that the Lord's mercy and compassion are new every morning.&nbsp;
"The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh
him"(Lam. 3:25).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, beloved Gardener, come into Your garden;
eat Your pleasant fruits; gather Your myrrh, and spice (S.O.S. 4:15-5:1).&nbsp;
May our fruit be as sweet to you as yours is to us (S.O.S. 2:3).
