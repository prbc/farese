<P>Words sometimes mean different things to different people. Take for
instance the word "father." As an adult, we know what the word, father,
means, and what he is supposed to be, and do, if we have read our bibles.
But in many cases, fathers have failed to be a good parent, not just in
minor things, but in major things. This has wounded many for life, and
because it has, it has hindered the growth of many Christians. Worse than
that, it has kept many from even seeking the Lord because their fathers
were professing Christians, and they knew that the Lord really didn't mean
much to them. They lived as the world, lying, cheating, cursing<B>,</B>
with no time for the children or no enjoyment in them, so they didn't want
any part of "their religion." Is it any wonder if we aren't finding any
comfort in times of suffering or trials if we think our Heavenly Father
is as an earthly father?

<P>Let's take a look at the Lord's Father so that we may have a true understanding
of what a good father is, and does, not just for the sake of knowing, but
so that we may believe, trust, and love our heavenly Father more as He
loves us. This will strengthen us to fight against sin, overcoming it to
the glory of God, thereby bringing more joy into our lives. The love of
the Father was not known very clearly in the Old Testament. This is why
many don't know it in all its glory. Only the gospel has revealed it.

<P>The Lord Jesus Christ had one purpose for coming into this world. It
was to reveal the great love of God, the Father, for lost sinners, especially
His elect, in order to bring them to salvation. All that are Christians
now have heard and been taught by Him. He is the One that draws them, and
teaches them (Jn.6:44-45). He has translated them from death unto life;
brought them to Christ giving them life and love in Him (Col. 1:12-13).

<P>All good fathers love their children, but our Heavenly Father's love
is greatly different than human love. God's love is equal, constant, not
capable of growing or diminishing. God, the Father, loves all His children
alike and will ALWAYS love them. His love is eternal, unchangeable, and
free. The love of God in itself is the eternal purpose and act of His will.
This can no more change than God, Himself. If it could, no flesh could,
or would, be saved.

<P>God loves His people even in their sinning -- His people -- not their
sinning. This is why we are not consumed (Lam. 3:22-23). God is always
faithful in keeping His word (Phil. 1:6). The purpose of His will can never
change, only the dispensation of His grace. He rebukes, chastens, hides
His face, smites, but all is done in love and for our profit (Heb. 12:6,
10).

<P>The devil is a master at tempting us with evil thoughts about our God,
and Father. He has always done this. We must not let him do this to us.
We must see the love of the Father in the Lord Jesus Christ. He was always
kind, compassionate, forbearing, gracious, not easily angered, longsuffering,
merciful, abundant in goodness and truth. He says, "He that has seen Me,
has seen the Father" (Jn. 14:9). Please don't wait until you FEEL LIKE
He loves you before you believe this truth. That would rob God of His glory.
It wasn't that we loved Him first, but that He loved us (1 Jn. 4:9-10).
The Lord told His disciples that He didn't have to pray to the Father for
Him to love them. He already did. (Jn. 16:23-27). Let us not question the
sincere love of the Father. If we don't believe ALL the promises of God
in Christ, we shall go on our way limping, and grieving the Holy Spirit.
His love won't have any sweetness in it for us unless we continually receive
it by faith no matter what our daily circumstances may be.

<P>The Lord's Father gave Him His greatest treasure, that which was most
precious to Him, HIS PEOPLE, as HIS INHERITANCE, because HE LOVED THEM
AS HE LOVED HIS OWN SON. (Jn. 17:23, 26. Isa. 43:4).

<P>Oh Christian, see THIS LOVE continually in all your difficulties, in
all your trials, and in all your suffering. It will bring you much comfort
and even joy. John 17 is the Lord's prayer to His Father before He gives
Himself up to die, unjustly, for us. The Father never stopped loving His
Son, nor did the Son stop loving His Father even though evil things were
going to happen to Him.

<P>May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, open the
eyes of our understanding more and more, that we may know what the riches
are of the glory of HIS INHERITANCE in the saints (Eph. 1:17-18). And may
you who are without Christ come to Him today. He is the only way to know
and experience the love of the Father -- the love of God (Jn. 14:6).</TD>
