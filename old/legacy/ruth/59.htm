<P>"He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake" (Psa.
23:3).

<P>God’s name is very important to Him; He has commanded us not to take
it in vain (Ex. 20:7). May He give us grace in these difficult days to
consider, and to know, if we are obeying this command.&nbsp;

<P>The Lord leads His sheep in the paths of righteousness for His name’s
sake. He is very jealous for His name. He does all that He does for His
name’s sake (Ezek. 36:22, 39:25). He says His name is "the Lord, the Lord
God, merciful, and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and
truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression
and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children and upon the children’s children to the third
and the fourth generation" (Ex. 34:6-7).&nbsp;

<P>We are His sheep and He is our Good Shepherd. Are the people around
us seeing how well He takes care of His sheep, or do they see us full of
disease, sickly and not eating well, full of discord, butting each other,
cast down, almost at death’s door?

<P>If we are not spiritually well, feeding on the Lord daily, trusting
in Him in all situations, believing His promises, loving Him above all,
serving Him and praising Him in all things and for all things, then we
are dishonoring His name, shaming Him before an unbelieving world, saying
by our disobedience, our murmuring and complaining, our lack of joy – "Our
Shepherd is not merciful, gracious, and forgiving, not longsuffering, abundant
in goodness and truth. We don’t like the way He is taking care of us. We
can do a better job of it ourselves."

<P>He has marked our ear with His name - "<I>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS"</I>
(Jer. 33:16). Let us live that truth to His glory and then it shall be
to Him a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all the nations of
the earth, who shall hear all the good that He does to us (Jer. 33:9).&nbsp;

<P>Oh Lord, lead us and guide us in the paths of righteousness for Your
name’s sake. Make us to lie down in pastures of tender grass; lead us to
still waters of rest. Declare Your name to us, that we may be able to manifest
Your love to the glory of Your name, forever (Jn. 17:26).
