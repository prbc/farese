<P>Oh, how we need grace in these days to obey the word of God.  The Lord says, "Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and feed on His faithfulness" - FEED ON HIS FAITHFULNESS (Psa. 37:3).
<p>
Oh, that we would, oh, that we could, all the days of our lives.  Oh, what comfort, what peace, what joy we would have then, instead of days, weeks, months, or even years of misery thinking that now our God is against us as is written in Lamentations 3:1-18.
<p>
Oh, that we might always believe that we are afflicted because of HIS FAITHFULNESS to us (Psa. 119:75).  His heart is never in His afflicting; He never afflicts willingly (Lam. 3:33);  it is always for our discipline and growth, done in love (Heb. 12:6).  He must purge, He must perfect, He must establish, He must strengthen, and He must settle us (Jn. 15:2, I Pet. 5:10).  If He didn't, we would be consumed.  It is because of His mercies that we are not; it is because His compassions fail not; they are new every morning as we arise to face the day.  No wonder the bible says, "GREAT IS YOUR FAITHFULNESS" (Lam. 3:22-23).
<p>
Let us not abuse, or hate His faithfulness as some of the people of Israel did.  Their way to glory was through the desert, but they fell short because they were not willing to put their trust in God; they entered not because of unbelief (Heb. 3:8-19).  Let us not make the same fatal mistakes (Num. 14:32, I Cor. 10:5-14).
<p>
If the Lord is not really our portion in this life, we will never be able to say, "It is good that I have been afflicted that I may learn Your statutes" (Psa. 119:71).  Only those that are finding their happiness, their life, their all in Him, will be able to say, "The Lord is my portion (He is enough), therefore I will hope in Him.  The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeks Him (Lam. 3:24-25).  
<p>
Let us feed continually on HIS FAITHFULNESS, growing into His likeness, to His glory and our good.  Let us honor our Shepherd's name!
