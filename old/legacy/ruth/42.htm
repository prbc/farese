<P>Job’s life had been so filled with grief, pain, and sorrow for such
a long time that now he wishes for death (Job 6:9). Life had lost all its
savor, all its goodness for him. It is now as the white of an egg eaten
without salt (Job 6:6).

<P>Perhaps, dear reader, your life seems to be somewhat like this. You
think about death at times, as the burden seems too heavy to bear. What
are you to do?

<P>LOOK FOR THE SALT, and salt your "egg white" well, so that you can not
only swallow it, but even find some sweetness in it.&nbsp;

<P>The salt that you must use is the SALT OF THE COVENANT OF OUR GOD (Lev.
2:13). It signifies <U>the</U> <U>imperishableness</U> <U>of Jehovah’s</U>
<U>love</U> <U>for</U> <U>His</U> <U>people</U> (Numb. 18:19). It is a
covenant that is incapable of being annulled (II Ch. 13:5).

<P>David was a good example of a man, well-salted. When Saul was looking
for him to kill him, David found him asleep and could have killed him,
but did not (I Sam. 26:7-9).

<P>When his son, Absalom, tried to take over his kingdom, David had to
flee from Jerusalem for his life. As he fled a man named Shimei cursed
him and threw stones at him (II Sam. 16:5-6). His men wanted to kill Shimei,
but David said, "Let him alone – for the Lord has bidden him" (II Sam.
16:11). <U>David</U> <U>sees</U> <U>God’s</U> <U>love</U> <U>in</U> <U>all</U>
<U>things</U>. He has salted himself well with the salt of the covenant.&nbsp;

<P>Read how he does this in II Sam. 22:1-51. What God did for David He
will do, and does do, for all His children that trust in Him. This is why
David could say, "Although my house is not so with God (not what he wishes
it were) yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant (a covenant of
salt) ordered in all things and <U>sure</U>: For this is all my salvation,
and all my desire, although He make it not to grow" (II Sam. 23:5). These
are the <U>sure</U> <U>mercies</U> <U>of</U> <U>David</U>, and they are
ours in Christ (Isa. 55:3, Acts 13:34).

<P>Salt was a very valuable commodity in the East, Food was in great need
of salt, especially animal food because of the heat there, to keep it from
perishing. Infants were also rubbed with salt to make the skin dense and
firm, and for purification and dedication of them to God. Elisha used it
for purification of water (II Kgs. 20-21). There also was a custom among
the Arabs that no matter how much one hated you, if you once tasted his
salt, he would die to save you.

<P>This is what the salt of the covenant does for us. It keeps us from
perishing because our Lord became salt for us. We did not have any salt
to make our "egg whites" acceptable to God, so our blessed Lord became
salt for us. He invited us to His table and made us to sit down with Him
and eat His salt. Then He died to save us so that we would never perish.
Now He says to us, "Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another"
(Mk. 9:50).

<P>Our sacrifices are acceptable now only if they are well-salted. Without
love they profit nothing (I Cor. 13:3). We are to be the salt of the earth,
but if our salt has lost its savor, what good is it (Matt., 5:13)? Even
our speech is to be seasoned with salt (Col. 4:6).

<P>May we heed our Lord’s commands as well as His warnings. He says, "Everyone
shall be salted with fire" (Mk. 9:49). For the believers it shall be the
"refiner’s fire," burning off the dross to purify the gold and silver (Mal.
3:3). The righteous can withstand this fire as it is a part of their present
salting as a "living sacrifice" (Lev. 2:13, Isa. 33:14-15, Rom. 12:1).
But for the unbelievers, it will be a consuming fire that will always be
burning them, and their worm will never die (Mk. 9:43-49, Heb. 12:29).&nbsp;

<P>Dear Unbeliever, may it not be said of you by the Lord on your dying
day, "<U>You</U> <U>were</U> <U>not</U> <U>salted</U> <U>at</U> <U>all</U>,
nor swaddled at all," for then you will be dying, eternally (Ezek. 16:4,
Rev. 21:8).
