<P>Years ago it used to be a common sight to see mothers wheeling their
baby carriages down the sidewalk to give their children some "fresh air."
Oh, how the babies liked this! How content, how peaceful, how happy they
all were.

<P>Our God, in His mercy, has given us a picture in His word to show us
how well taken care of we all are, and continually will be, when we are
born into His family, and become His children (Jn. 1:12-13).

<P>He says, "Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the
house of Israel, Who have been upheld by Me from birth, Who have been carried
from the womb: Even to your old age, I am He, And even to gray hairs I
will carry you! I have made, and I will bear; Even I will carry, and will
deliver you (Isa. 46:3-4).&nbsp;

<P>May we not shame Him before all those that do not love Him by riding
in His carriage screaming, and fretting all the way. He has carried us
from the moment we were born, and will carry us and deliver us safely to
"our new home."

<P>Oh, Christian, -- enjoy the ride, breathe the fresh air, and be content.
If you are burdened with a heavy load, perhaps it is because you are trying
to make your own carriage, and push it by yourself. Picture in your mind
a baby trying to do this, and you will see how impossible, how unreasonable,
and how foolish this is. If you continue to do this, you will become stooped
over and bent down with the heavy load, and finally led off into captivity
as it states in Isa. 46:1-2.&nbsp;

<P>Rest well in your carriage. It is a very expensive and well built one.
It will never fall apart, or rust away like one of our modern cars; it
will carry you comfortably, lovingly, and safely <B>all the way home.</B>

<P>The Lord says, "LISTEN TO ME." May He give us ears to hear Him.</TD>
