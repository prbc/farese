<center><b><font size=+1>HIS OLIVE TREE</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree,
fair, and of goodly fruit" (Jer. 11:16).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has chosen to call His people "a green
olive tree" because the nature and the use for this tree is not only typical
of His people, but more importantly, typical of the Lord, yet without their
sin (Hos. 14:6).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olive trees are very beautiful trees, but their
trunks are twisted and gnarled.&nbsp; All bear the mark of suffering; they
display the agony of the Lord.&nbsp; Some are split to the heart of the
tree, broken from the root upward as with an ax.&nbsp; It is a wonder how
they live, but all are full of life.&nbsp; Some live for centuries and
still bear fruit.&nbsp; Their leaves are grayish green and never fall off
suggesting great strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The olive tree produces excellent oil from
almost sterile, rocky soil.&nbsp; The oil was released in olden times by
bruising, pressing, and treading on the olives (Mic. 6:15).&nbsp; The oil
was used as food (as we use butter) and for anointing.&nbsp; It was also
used in lamps - some in the temple as well as houses - to lighten the world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olive wood is fine grained, solid, and yellowish
in color.&nbsp; It was so beautiful that it was used to make the cherubim,
doors, and posts for the house of God.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old olive sends out young suckers which
spring up around the parent tree, which in after ages when the parent's
strength fails, shelters it on every side from the blast of the storms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old roots were used for firewood.&nbsp; Even
these old roots though would grow again if they were buried in the ground.&nbsp;
They are so full of the oil of life that they burn with a clearer and brighter
flame than any other tree.&nbsp; Even in perishing they do their best to
enlighten those that have cast them into the fire.&nbsp; They glorify God
even in the fire (Isa. 24:15).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The olive branch has always been a sign of
peace since Noah's day (Gen. 8:11).&nbsp; It is an emblem of the godly
in spirit constantly dwelling in the house of God (Psa. 52:8).&nbsp; Their
children will be like olive plants round about the table (Psa. 128:3).&nbsp;
They will be a blessing to their parents as well as to the world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we live and die as the old olive tree.&nbsp;
May we lighten our world as we "burn out."&nbsp; May our roots produce
godly children that will not only be a blessing to us, but to the whole
world, glorifying God.&nbsp; Make it so, Lord.&nbsp; Make it so!
