<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS TREASURE (Isaiah 33:6)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>As we come to the day that the world calls Christmas, may we as Christians
think of something else besides buying presents, decorating houses, and
running here and there. Let us fill our minds and our thoughts with HIS
TREASURE - HIS GIFT - to us - the treasure we have in earthen vessels,
Christ in us, the hope of glory (II Cor. 4:7, Col. 1:27). Here are unsearchable
riches, THE TREASURE OF HEAVEN.&nbsp;

<P>Oh, that we could give THIS GIFT to all those that are without it this
day.&nbsp;

<P>We know that only God can enable lost men and women to behold His glory
in Christ Jesus, but there is something that we can do. We can seek grace
to show them the treasures of darkness (Isa. 45:3). These shine with a
greater glory and catch the eye of all.&nbsp;

<P>These treasures of darkness are those truths we learn through suffering,
pain, and death; truths of the greatness, the goodness and the glory of
God; a living knowledge and a true knowledge of self.&nbsp;

<P>Job learned about these treasures and after years of suffering said,
"I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth
Thee. Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6).&nbsp;

<P>May we take the advice of Proverbs 2:3-5 which says, "Yea, if Thou criest
after knowledge and liftest thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest
her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasure; then shalt thou
understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God."&nbsp;

<P>May we learn to thank God in and for, all things, especially for those
treasures of darkness. This is the "battery" that will make "our Christmas
lights" shine much more brightly in a lost, dark world.&nbsp;

<P>May many come to find this hidden treasure and receive The Greatest
Gift that God has - HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON.&nbsp;

<P>My prayer for each one of us is, "Oh Lord open up unto us Your good
treasure and give us eyes to behold its glory" (Deut. 28:12). Make it so,
Lord - make it so to the glory of Your precious name.&nbsp;</TD>
