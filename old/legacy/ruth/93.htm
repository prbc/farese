<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and
I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say
to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say,
Thou art my God (Hos. 2:23).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every gardener must sow some seeds if he expects
to have a garden; all that grows naturally is weeds.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord wanted a garden for Himself and came
to earth as a man to sow His seed so that He might have a people - a garden
- for Himself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now He tells His people to follow Him - to
sow His seed.&nbsp; He says that if we do it, as He did it, we shall reap
in joy (Psa. 126:5-6).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we sow the seed, we will see that
there are four different effects.&nbsp; Sometimes it falls on ground so
hard that it stops the seed from developing; the birds (Satan) eat it right
away.&nbsp; Sometimes it falls on stony ground where there is only a little
earth.&nbsp; It springs up a little, but because it doesn't have any root
(the Lord Jesus Christ), it withers away from the heat of the sun.&nbsp;
Sometimes it grows up but there are so many thorns around it that they
choke the plant and it never bears any fruit; thorns such as cares of this
world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust of other things.&nbsp;
Then there is the seed that falls on good ground - ground that the Lord
has cultivated and made good, and this always bears fruit, some thirty,
some sixty, and some a hundredfold (Mk. 4:3-8, 14-20).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want to grow well and produce fruit for
our Lord, we must follow our Lord. He says, "…Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit" (Jn. 12:24).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We (our corrupt seed) must die to self through
the work of His Spirit so that Christ may dwell in our hearts and we become
rooted and grounded in love (Lk. 9:23-24, Eph. 3:16-19).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then will we be rooted and built up, established
in the faith, abounding with thanksgiving (Col. 2:7).&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
