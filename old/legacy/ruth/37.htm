<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>His Wedding Day&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>As June approaches many young men and women are thinking about their
wedding day. Could any of us imagine that either one of them would be complaining
or angry with their beloved with such thoughts in their minds?

<P>Perhaps with men and women who are sinners this could happen, but certainly
not with our Lord. From the moment He chose His bride, it has been a day
of the gladness of His heart (S.O.S. 3:11). His heart is glad in us without
a bit of sorrow. Every day we live is "His wedding day" as now there is
no time with Him; as God He lives in the eternal present.&nbsp;

<P>What I want to ask you now is, "Have you bought your wedding dress yet,
and are you sure that He will be pleased with it?" Let me tell you how
you may be sure.&nbsp;

<P>Firstly, it must be white. White is the color of divinity. The throne
of God is white (Rev. 20:11). When the Lord was transfigured His raiment
became shining, exceeding white as snow (Mk. 9:3). Doves are white. White
speaks of innocence and purity. His dove must wear white (Rev. 19:7-8).&nbsp;

<P>The material must be completely new (Matt. 9:16, II Cor. 5:17).&nbsp;

<P>It must be long enough to cover all. He will not be pleased if it is
too short or too narrow. It cannot be made partly by the works of man and
partly by God (Isa. 28:20, Eph. 2:8-9).

<P>It must be made by Him; His name must be on it as an "original" (S.O.S.
1:11, Rev. 3:12).

<P>It must be washed well so that it will be white as snow (Isa. 1:18,
Rev. 7:13-14).

<P>It must be <U>chosen</U> <U>by</U> <U>Him</U>, <U>bought</U> <U>from</U>
<U>Him</U>, and <U>worn</U> <U>every</U> <U>day</U> forever afterwards,
so that your nakedness will not be seen (Ezek. 16:8, Rev. 3:18, I Cor.
15:2).

<P>If we are to be filled with joy now, as well as on our wedding day,
we must be able to say in truth the words of Isa. 61:10 about ourselves.
"He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with
the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments,
and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels." If He has not, we shall
stand naked on the day of the wedding and be cast out into utter darkness
(Matt. 22:11-13).&nbsp;

<P>But if we are His doves, made white by His blood and the work of the
Holy Spirit, we shall be seen on our wedding day not with just a beautiful
white dress, but a dress that&nbsp;

<P>has become pure gold. Only our wings will be covered with silver to
always remind us of the price of redemption that our blessed Lord had to
pay to buy us back for Himself, so that we could be <U>His</U> <U>bride</U>
– <U>His</U> <U>dove</U> – <U>His</U> <U>love</U>, <U>forever</U> (Psa.
45:13, 68:13).

<P>Oh, glorious day – come Lord Jesus, come quickly!!
