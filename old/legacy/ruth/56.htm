<P>"He makes me to lie down in green pastures" (Psa. 23:2).

<P>Sheep are so dumb that they have to be made to do what is good for them.
They would rather go their own way, and because they are dumb, stubborn,
and rebellious, they have to be made to do things that their nature fights
against, or they wouldn’t survive (Rom. 7:18-19)

<P>They love to wander, and if they get lost, it could mean their life
in a short time. There are dangers everywhere, and they are completely
helpless. If a favorite lamb keeps wandering off, a shepherd will sometimes
break his legs, and then carry him on his shoulders until he is healed.
A loving relationship is developed by this close contact and the lamb never
wanders off again (Deut. 33:12).

<P>Sheep are very timid and fearful. They will not lie down and rest if
they are afraid. There are four causes of fear in sheep.

<P>One is from other animals hurting, or killing them. Even a loud strange
noise, or object seen unexpectedly, can cause a whole flock to stampede.

<P>The second cause is from friction from other sheep (Prov. 6:19). With
animals there is always an order of dominance. With sheep it is called
the "butting order." Generally an arrogant and domineering old ewe will
be the boss of a bunch of sheep. She maintains this position by butting
and driving other ewes, or lambs, away from the best grazing (Ezek. 34:21-22).

<P>The third cause is from parasites, insects, and disease. Sheep suffer
a lot in the summer from all kinds of flies and ticks. They are tormented
by these pests and cannot rest unless the shepherd applies insect repellents,
or dips them to clear their fleeces of ticks. (This is where the expression,
"Don’t bug me," came from.)

<P>Scab is another disease common to sheep. Sheep love to rub heads in
an affectionate and friendly manner. Scab is found most often around the
head. When the sheep rub together, the infection spreads quickly from one
to another. (Scab is significant of sin. The words of a talebearer, whisperer,
or busybody are as wounds Prov. 16:28, 18:8.)

<P>The fourth fear is from hunger. Sheep are always hungry. Most sheep
are raised in countries where the climate is dry, semi-arid. The sheep
aren’t so susceptible to health problems there. But in these countries
you don’t find many green pastures; green pastures are the product of tremendous
labor, time, and skill in land use.&nbsp;

<P>Our Shepherd spared nothing to feed His sheep with the best pasture.
Nothing satisfies a sheep owner more than to see his flock doing well,
and quietly feeding to their full, able to lie down and rest, ruminate,
and gain.&nbsp;

<P>Our Good Shepherd has met all the needs of His sheep. We no longer have
any need to fear. We are justified freely by His grace (Rom. 3:24). He
will deliver us from every evil work and preserve us for His heavenly kingdom
(II Tim. 4:18). Let us eat well in His "green pastures" of scripture and
then we will be fat and flourishing, and our Shepherd shall see the travail
of His soul and shall be satisfied (Isa. 53:11).

<P>To Him be glory forever and ever!!!
