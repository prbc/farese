<center><b><font size=+1>HIS LAST WORDS TO HIS FELLOW GARDENERS</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For we are labourers together with God; ye
are God's husbandry, ye are God's building" (I Cor. 3:9).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord has left us His last words as laborers
together with Him.&nbsp; Let us take heed to them so that we will be filled
with joy and comfort as we continue to sow His precious seed in this evil
world.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.&nbsp; For as the heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my ways, higher than your ways, and my
thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow
from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh
it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to
the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and
it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.&nbsp; For ye shall go
out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills
shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field
shall clap their hands.&nbsp; Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir
tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall
be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut
off" (Isa. 55:8-13).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh happy day!!&nbsp; No more thorns, no more
briers. Clap your hands and sing with joy trees of the Lord; the awaited
day has come.&nbsp; His garden will now be without weeds and without thorns,
forever!!
