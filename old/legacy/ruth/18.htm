<P>Every soldier that goes to war must learn how to use his weapons. They
will be of no use to him if he hasn't been taught. Let us learn from our
"Captain" how to use these weapons for He will teach our hands to war and
our fingers to fight (Psa. 144:1). We must always keep in mind though,
that the weapons of our warfare are not "carnal," not the weapons that
the world uses to fight with. We must use the weapons that God has given
to us, and then they shall "be mighty through God to the pulling down of
strong holds" (II Cor.10:4).&nbsp;

<P>First let me tell you about a few of the weapons that soldiers carried
and fought with many years ago. Then you may better understand the spiritual
application of the word of God.&nbsp;

<P>Soldiers had a sword that they carried in a sheath; it rested on the
thigh and was held in place by a girdle. It was lighter and shorter than
our modern sword, and some were two edged. This weapon was only worn in
time of war.&nbsp;

<P>Then there was the spear that a soldier, or a king, always kept close
by. Saul kept it at his head while sleeping, in his hand when gathering
soldiers, and leaned on it when dying (I Sam. 26:7, 22:6, 2 Sam. 1:6).&nbsp;

<P>Then there was the javelin, a lighter, easier to hold and maneuverable
weapon that was carried on the back between the shoulders, and could be
thrown long distances in a moment. The word ejaculation is derived from
jaculum, "javelin."&nbsp;

<P>The sword is the word of God and, the spear and javelin are our prayers,
shot out mightily, when prayed in the Spirit and by the help of the Spirit.
These are our offensive weapons (Eph. 6:17-18).&nbsp;

<P>The Lord began His ministry with prayer, and as soon as He was baptized,
heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and His Father
said, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased" (Lk 3:21-22).
Immediately He is led into the wilderness where for forty days He fasted
and prayed, and was tempted by the devil. He answered the devil with the
word of God, using His sword with great skill, and wounding the devil so
severely that he had to leave Him for a time (Matt. 4:3-11).&nbsp;

<P>We see Him rising early in the morning to pray, to prepare His heart
for service (Mk. 1:35). He seeks His Father to maintain the fellowship
that was His from all eternity. He could do nothing from His own independent
will, but only from His Father as they are One (Jn. 5:19,30, 8:28). He
has His spear always at His head, or in His hand, ready to use it on all
occasions.&nbsp;

<P>He prays, and throws His javelin for the life of others so that they
may come alive, or stay alive (Lk. 22:31-32, 23:34, Jn. 11:41-44).&nbsp;

<P>When He is nearing His time to die, and is dying, He leans on His spear,
takes out His sword, and throws His javelin for His loved ones, to kill
their enemies and His. Then with a loud voice He cries out, "It is finished"
(Lk. 23:46, Jn. 17, 19:30). He mounts up with wings as eagles, not defeated,
but victorious. He has unsheathed His sword and killed His last enemy --
and ours -- DEATH. "Death is swallowed up in victory" (I Cor. 15:55-57).&nbsp;

<P>May we, as our Lord, take up our weapons daily, and cast out all human
reasoning that contradicts the word of God, and the promises of God, and
know that no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper (II Cor. 10:5,
Isa. 54:17).&nbsp;</TD>
