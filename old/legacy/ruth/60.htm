<P>"He restores my soul" (Psa. 23:3).

<P>This speaks of restoring life. Sheep are spoken of as "cast down." It
means that they are on their backs with their feet in the air. They cannot
get up by themselves. They will die in a short time as gases build up and
cut off their circulation. The shepherd has to restore them to their feet
(Psa. 36:12, 43:5).

<P>Sheep that choose the soft, comfortable places in the ground roll over
easily. Too much wool weighs them down also and they become cast. (This
is a type of our own hopes and desires.) No priest was ever allowed to
wear wool in the Holy of Holies. It speaks of self, of pride, and of personal
preference (Ezek. 44:17). The shepherd has to shear the sheep - cut off
its wool - to keep down the danger.

<P>Sheep that are too fat roll over easily. (Type of too many possessions.)
They have to be put on a strict diet (Matt. 19:23). It is a sad sight to
see such a sheep with its feet in the air. It flays frantically, struggling
to stand up without success. Sometimes it bleats a little for help, but
usually it lies there lashing about in frightened frustration.

<P>Here is a sad picture of what can happen to a Christian if he (or she)
falls into sin because of neglect to watch and pray (Matt. 26:41). Yet
there are some sheep, obedient sheep, that become cast every second or
third day; it is only the diligence of the shepherd that makes it possible
for them to survive. These are sheep that are expecting; sheep that are
called "heavy in lamb."&nbsp;

<P>Here is a picture of a Christian working, praying, doing all that is
possible by God’s grace to grow, and to bring new life into the world,
so "heavy in lamb" that hasn’t come to birth, that he (or she) rolls over
quite frequently. The weight of their concern is just too much for them.

<P>Oh, cast down sheep, call out to your Shepherd. He is not a man that
cannot restore you even if you have died. He is the eternal God - the resurrection
and the life. He who believes in Him, though he may die, he shall live.
And whoever lives and believes in Him shall never die (Jn. 11:15-26).

<P>Oh Lord, send out your light, and your truth. Let them lead us. Bring
us to Your holy hill, You are our God, our Shepherd; we hope in you (Psa.
43:3-5).
