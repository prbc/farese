<center><b><font size=+1>HIS PLOWING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? Doth
he open and break the clods of his ground" (Isa. 28:24)?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times the Master Gardener has to plow up
the soil of His garden; "wild" flowers have been growing in it of all kinds,
but they are "wild" and He has purposed a crop.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the soil is turned over it looks dark
and ugly, but soon He will sow His seed; He will thresh His wheat and grind
it up to make bread to feed the world (Isa. 28:24-29).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel Rutherford said many years ago, "Why
should I start at the plow of my Lord that makes the deep furrows on my
soul?&nbsp; I know He is no idle Husbandman (Gardener); He purposes a crop."&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, your life may be "all plowed
up" right now but, fear not; it is the necessary work of your faithful
Gardener.&nbsp; He purposes a crop and He tells us what that "crop" is
in Isaiah 51:3.&nbsp; "For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort
all her waste places; and he will make her desert like the garden of the
Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice
of melody."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This "crop" is very important to our Gardener.&nbsp;
He will never receive the glory and honor that He deserves unless His garden
is producing this fruit (joy, gladness, thanks- giving and singing).&nbsp;
This is a very serious matter.&nbsp; We must kill the "bugs" that are eating
up this fruit.&nbsp; Here is the reason why:&nbsp; "Because thou servedst
not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the
abundance of all things; Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which
the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
and in want of all things; and he shall put a yoke or iron upon thy neck,
until he have destroyed thee" (Deut. 28:47-48).&nbsp; "Be filled with the
Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always
for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ"
(Eph. 5:18-20).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the branch of His planting, the work
of His hands that He may be glorified.&nbsp; May we not dishonor His name
by not living according to His will and word.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God will be faithful to all His words.&nbsp;
Shall He joy over us with singing and He not receive the same from us (Zeph.
3:17)?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp;&nbsp;
