<center><b><font size=+1>HIS STRIPPING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the soldiers, when they had crucified
Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part;
and also his coat; now the coat was without seams, woven from the top throughout.
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots
for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, which
saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast
lots" (Jn. 19:23-24)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our Lord was betrayed by Judas and given
over to the crowd, they took Him to the high priest's house and then to
Pontius Pilate.&nbsp; Then Pilate's soldiers took Him into the Praetorium
(a barrack for soldiers) and stripped Him, and put a scarlet robe on Him,
a crown of thorns, on His head, and a reed in His hand and bowed the knee
before Him, mocking Him; then they spit on Him and struck Him on the head
with a reed. Later they took Him to be crucified and stripped Him of all
His clothes, and cast lots for them (Matt. 27:27-31). This is the shameful
and dishonoring experience that the Lord had to pass through, and the great
price that He had to pay in order to save us.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a heart-breaking experience to be stripped
of loved ones, of friends, of health, of all assets; Job suffered this.&nbsp;
It is a heart-breaking experience to be taken away from your home and all
your loved ones and thrown among a people that hate you and mistreat you;
Joseph experienced this.&nbsp; It is a heart-breaking experience to be
falsely accused of something and have to live with the shame and dishonor,
and then be unjustly tortured and killed for it; many Christian men, women,
and children know something about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is but One, the only One - our Master
Gardener, that really knows what it is to be stripped of all - of everything
possible - and that is the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, you who are in such a state
right now; God has stripped you of some things, yet you still have your
life.&nbsp; Please hear His voice - "What I do thou knowest not now; but
thou shalt know hereafter" (Jn. 13:7).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord is building His house, His temple.&nbsp;
He has chosen to build it with His great strong cedars of Lebanon (Psa.
104:16).&nbsp; They have to be cut down, stripped, cut into boards, shipped
out of their original home to a foreign land - to Jerusalem.&nbsp; But
look, they are placed in the temple of the living God, even in the most
holy place where God dwells.&nbsp; But look again; these boards are all
covered now with gold.&nbsp; Oh, how glorious they all are (I Kgs. 5:1-9,
6:16-22).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Christian, you have been brought out of
your natural state; God has made you His.&nbsp; You are His garden.&nbsp;
Even your fragrance is very sweet and pleasing to Him now because He has
covered you with His gold, His robe of righteousness (Psa. 45:9,13, Rev.
7:14). Surely the cutting, the stripping, the losing, the moving, will
be worth it all!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
