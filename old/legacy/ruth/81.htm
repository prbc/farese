<center><b><font size=+1>HIS QUALIFICATIONS</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>By R. T. Holmes&nbsp;</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which in his times he shall show, who is the
blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords; Who
only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach
unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see who alone has immortality, dwelling
in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see; to whom be honour
and power everlasting. Amen" (I Ti. 6:15-16).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one is going to be a Master Gardener, there
is a great deal that he must not only know, but be able to do, in order
to work it all out in life.&nbsp; He must have time, energy, and wisdom;
he must have an eye for beauty, color, and design; so many things are necessary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Master Gardener - the Lord of glory - fills
all the qualifications perfectly.&nbsp; He has all knowledge, all time,
all power, and all wisdom.&nbsp; His eye for beauty is seen everywhere
in creation; who can deny it?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is an unseen beauty that surpasses
all that is seen; it is the beauty seen in God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
as He manifested the true image of God.&nbsp; He was, and is,&nbsp; altogether
lovely (S.O.S. 5:16).&nbsp; It is into this image that our Master Gardener
is shaping and forming His garden - His people (Rom. 8:29).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, what a privilege; what a joy to be made
just like Him.&nbsp; Oh, the wonder and the glory of it all!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He takes great pleasure in going down into
His garden, enjoying the beauty of His lilies and the fragrance of the
spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather His lilies (S.O.S. 6:2-3).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, how these verses should enliven our weak
spirits as we see what pleasure our Lord has in seeing His image formed
in us, and how He delights to feed on the fruit that He is producing in
us - working in us to will and to do (Phil. 2:13).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us taste this sweetness, daily, as we go
out into this evil world.&nbsp; It will strengthen us as we see the end
of all His working; the gathering of His lilies to His own bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When He comes in time to cut down His lilies from among the thorns, they
will rest quietly and peacefully close to His heart, adorning His heavenly
home forever after (S.O.S. 2:2).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take heart Christian - this Master Gardener
cannot fail to produce perfect lilies.&nbsp; He has all the necessary qualifications.&nbsp;
