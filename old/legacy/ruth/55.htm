<P>"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want" (Psa. 23:1).

<P>These are the words of David, one of the Lord’s sheep. He had learned
by God’s grace that his Shepherd was good; that He was loving, and that
He would faithfully take care of all his needs, all of his life.&nbsp;

<P>Here was a sheep that stayed close to his Shepherd, except in the case
of Uriah (I Kgs. 15:5). He was a man after God’s own heart. There are always
a few sheep that stay close to the Shepherd; each one has been given a
name; they aren’t in any danger of getting lost or into trouble; not even
the wild beasts or thieves come near them as long as they stay close to
their Shepherd (Rev. 3:12). These sheep do get cast down once in a while,
but we will discuss that in a later issue.&nbsp;

<P>These sheep have learned to be content in any state (Phil. 4:11); they
are satisfied with their Shepherd. The food that He supplies is the very
best, and they are hungering and thirsting after it all the time (Jn. 6:54:57,
Matt. 5:6). They eat so much that some gain 100 lbs. in 100 days. They
are fat and flourishing (Psa. 92:14). They are so hungry for the Shepherd’s
food that He has prepared, that they don’t even mind if it is bitter; to
them it is sweet because it is making them grow to be just like their Shepherd
(Prov. 27:7).

<P>But then there are a great number of sheep that run from bush to bush
looking for some variety in life, some other source of satisfaction, and
only now and then lift their heads to see where the Shepherd is, or the
flock, so that they won’t get too far away and receive a rebuke from their
Keeper.

<P>Then there are those that are always restless and discontented, jumping
into everybody else’s field, straying away, and leading others to stray
away (I Pet. 4:15). If they keep doing this there comes a time when the
Shepherd has to either discipline them severely, or even take their life
so that they won’t keep upsetting the whole flock (I Cor. 11:30).

<P>Oh, that we all might come to such a state that we could say with Paul,
"I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content." But if not that,
"Having food and clothing, I am content" (I Tim. 6:8). The Lord has provided
His own flesh and blood to feed us. Surely we should be content with that!!!

<P>Oh Lord, save Your people and bless Your inheritance (Your sheep); shepherd
them also, and bear them up forever (Psa. 28:9). Lift up the heads with
Your staff that are caught in the thorny bushes. You are our glory; we
wait on You (Psa. 3:3, Matt. 13:22).
