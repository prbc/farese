<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thy people also shall be all righteous; they
shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of
my hands, that I may be glorified" (Isa. 60:21).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We think much about our planting, but let us
think, firstly, about the Lord's planting that we might understand why
our Lord was so well qualified to be our "Master Gardener."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Lord learned what it was, and what
it took, to be "a living plant" in the eyes of God; He learned obedience
by the things that He suffered (Heb. 5:8).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If trees are to live they must be planted in
a hole deep enough and wide enough to accommodate the spreading root system.&nbsp;
Oh, the breath and the depth of the hole that God had to dig for His dear
Son that we might be rooted and grounded in love (Eph. 3:17-19).&nbsp;
It was, and always will be, the deepest and darkest hole that any man could
be buried in - it was hell itself (Acts 2:31).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God planted His Son in this hole so that there
could be a tree of life - a tree that would never die, that He might graft
us into it.&nbsp; That tree is Christ, our Lord, He Is the root, the&nbsp;&nbsp;
branch, and the stem, the good olive tree (Isa. 11:l, 10, Zech. 3:8, 6:12,
Rom. 11:24).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, you may be "being dug up" right
now and feel as though this can't be the plan of God for you, but look
at the Lord and see how He was "dug up" for you; dug up by the lash, the
thorns, the blows, the nails, and the spear.&nbsp; Yet this was the Father's
plan so that you and I might have life and live it forever with Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not think that we have a better plan
for His garden.&nbsp; He is the Master Gardener and His plan is perfect.&nbsp;
Let us not rebel against the color, shape, or form that He chooses for
us.&nbsp; Surely He knows best!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the branch of His planting, the work
of His hands, that He may be glorified.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed be His name!</td>
