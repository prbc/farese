<p>"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul" (Gen.
2:7).
<p>If we are ever to become the Lord's garden, a flower that is sweet-smelling
to Him, we must know what we are, and always would be, without Him.&nbsp;
We are nothing but dust and ashes (Gen. 18:27).&nbsp; Of what use, of what
value, is dust and ashes?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>We are so filled with pride and love of self when we are born into the
world that only a powerful work of God can make us know, and believe, that
we are nothing in ourselves.&nbsp; "For if a man think himself to be something,
when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself" (Gal. 6:3)
<p>Our great value is only in God, in being His, and then being just a
vessel - an earthen vessel made of dust - to receive, enjoy, and manifest
the glory of God.&nbsp; We will only be enabled to do this if we are nothing
in ourselves; continually seeking to find our all in God.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>It is only he that humbles himself that shall be exalted (Lk. 14:11).&nbsp;
The Lord, Himself, is the proof of this truth.&nbsp; It is only he that
humbles himself as a little child that shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven (Matt. 18:3-4).&nbsp; The Lord will work this grace in us as we
seek Him with a desire to be conformed to His image.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>It will be a great struggle at first until we learn the joy of dying
to self to live for Him.&nbsp; But fear not, the Lord pities us because
He knows that we are nothing but dust (Psa. 103:13-14).&nbsp; Continue
to look for opportunities to humble yourself in the sight of God and He
will lift you up in due time (I Pet. 5:6).&nbsp; Let us glory in our weakness
that the strength of Christ may rest upon us (II Cor. 12:9).&nbsp;
<p>Let us be exceedingly thankful that we are not just dust, but His dust,
made in His image, precious in His eyes - His sweet-smelling garden!!!
