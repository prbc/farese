"You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over" (Psa. 23:5).&nbsp;

<P>Sheep suffer greatly in the summer from nose flies, insects, and scab.
They can become so infected and diseased that they lose weight, stop giving
milk, and will run around frantically, filled with fear, trying to relieve
themselves by beating their heads against trees, rocks, posts, or brush.
This at times leads to blindness or death.&nbsp;

<P>The shepherd has to make an oil made of olive oil, sulphur, and spices
to relieve this condition. He applies this as needed so that his sheep
will be healed and enabled to lie down quietly and rest.&nbsp;

<P>The anointing of our Good Shepherd is the sending of His Spirit to cure
us of not only "nose flies and scab," but the most fatal disease - that
of being a hater of God and a lover of sin (Rom. 8:7). Only a change of
nature could accomplish this and that is what our Shepherd did when He
anointed us with His Spirit (II Cor. 1:21-22). He made us to love God and
His commandments (Rom. 5:5, Psa. 119:127).&nbsp;

<P>But we must seek more anointing - more oil - because we are sheep -
His sheep - and sheep are <U>always</U> bothered with nose flies and scab
in the summer as long as they are on earth. Some will suffer more than
others with aggravations and personality conflicts.&nbsp;

<P>Let us ask our Shepherd to fill us with His Spirit, and arm us with
His mind (Eph. 5:18, Phil. 2:5-8, I Pet. 4:l, 8). We will then be enabled
to speak and act with grace – calmly, quietly, gently, and lovingly. We
won’t be running around angry, frustrated, irritated, or agitated as sheep,
"banging our heads against the wall" as though we didn’t have a shepherd.&nbsp;

<P>David was so well healed, that he could say not only that his "cup"
was filled, but that it was running over. This was because "his cup" was
His Shepherd - his life, his all (Psa. 16:5).&nbsp;

<P>May we come to such a state so that our Shepherd’s anointing will not
only be healing us, but will be running over to heal others as we have
been healed; healing even our enemies. Then we shall be just like our Shepherd
(Prov. 16:7).&nbsp;</TD>
