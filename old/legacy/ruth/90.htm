<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "…How long will this people provoke me? and
how long will it be ere they believe me.." (Num. 14:11)?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord is speaking about His people, His
garden, in this verse.&nbsp; They had come out of Egypt, seen so many signs
and miracles, yet the majority were filled with unbelief because of what
they now saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sins of unbelief are as "root suckers"; they
suck strength from the root and shoot up their own shoots out of the earth.
Gardeners have to either dig down and cut them off, or when they have grown
a little, the gardener wraps the whipline growth tightly around one hand
and yanks with all his might to separate the base of the sucker from the
rootstock.&nbsp; This is the only way to ensure that the root sucker will
not grow again.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Christian, watch for signs of unbelief in
your Christian life.&nbsp; If you can't rejoice in tribulation, you have
unbelief in your heart (Jas. 1:2-8).&nbsp; The Lord says, "All things are
for your sake" (II Cor. 4:15).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are His, He will have to use strong
and severe methods to bring you out of your unbelief so that your tree
will grow up strong and tall and deeply rooted.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is very grieved when He is doubted and dishonored
after He has shown so much mercy.&nbsp; He may withdraw His felt presence
from us until we learn to trust Him in all things (S.O.S. 5:6).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we learn to use all the evil, and all the
things we don't like in our lives, to grow in grace and the knowledge of
our Savior.&nbsp; That is what it is all there for.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Christian, don't be a root sucker!&nbsp;
You will be causing harm and shame to your Root.&nbsp; Ask your Gardener
to give you grace to get rid of all your unbelief (Mk. 9:24).&nbsp;</td>
