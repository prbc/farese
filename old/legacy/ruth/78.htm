<br><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></center>

<p>"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman" (Jn. 15:1).
<p>Every human being needs a "master gardener" if he is to grow and live
to the glory of God.&nbsp; It was no different for our Lord.&nbsp; He was
truly a man and He said that His Father was His husbandman (gardener).&nbsp;
<p>He was the vine that His Father planted in the world, and oh, how He
had to be pruned, to be crushed, and&nbsp; to be cut into so that He could
be the "tree of life" for all mankind.
<p>His Father had to cut Him back to His root, and it certainly looked
for awhile that He was dead forever.&nbsp; But from that root grew a new
tree - a tree of life, filled with fruit that if one eats of it, he (or
she) will live forever.&nbsp;
<p>The world's greatest blessing was the world's greatest sorrow ever seen.
<p>Dear reader, you may have many sorrows in this world, but there never
was any sorrow like the Lord's sorrow.&nbsp; He says to all of us, "Is
it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?&nbsp; behold, and see if there
be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the
Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger" (Lam. 1:12).&nbsp;
<p>His Father had to cut Him back to the ground so that we might live and
feed on His fruit forever.
<p>Oh come, come one, come all, and taste the sweetness of His fruit -
His love, His joy, His peace, His longsuffering, His kindness, His goodness,
His faithfulness, His gentleness, His self-control (Gal. 5:22-23). You
will then say the same words as His beloved. "As the apple tree among the
trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.&nbsp; I sat down under
his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste" (S.O.S.
2:3).
<p>This is the cure - this is the medicine - this is His fruit.&nbsp; Eat
much of it and you will go on your way rejoicing, now, and throughout eternity,
even as David did when he was in the wilderness (Psa. 63:1-7).</td>
