<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>His Dove (S.O.S. 6:9)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>In S.O.S. 6:9 we read, "My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the
only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her."

<P>What joy, what thanksgiving, what love this verse should stir up in
our hearts if we realize that the Lord is talking about us. But if it doesn't,
what then? Well this is why I thought it would be wise to go into more
depth of why the Lord calls His church, His people----HIS DOVE.

<P>Names in the Old Testament were a revelation of some truth about the
person's nature or life. To believe that the names of the Lord's beloved
one -- choice one -- only one, apply to us without having the nature of
the name to some degree, is to deceive ourselves.

<P>There are many things we need to know about doves that can teach us
some truths about our spiritual life, thereby being of great help and encouragement
to us. For this reason I will be writing more articles about "His Dove,"
Lord willing, so that we may see as much as possible of the riches of God's
word.

<P>He calls her my dove -- my dove because now she is His. He bought her
with His own blood (Rev. 5:9). She is now undefiled; His blood has washed
her completely (Rev. 1:5). Now only her feet need to be washed as she walks
around in a filthy, evil world (Jn. 13:8-10). She is one -- one body with
one head.

<P>She is to Him as no other; she is the <U>only one</U> - she is His choice
among all the women in the world (Jn. 17:9-10). His love is so great and
fervent for her that He says, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah,
comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners" (S.O.S. 6:4).

<P>Tirzah was a beautiful and elegant city that was east of Samaria. Jerusalem
was beautiful also, called "the joy of the whole earth" with its towers,
walls, and palaces rising majestically on its green hills.

<P>He is so struck with her beauty that He describes her with words that
were used by Arabian lovers years ago. Her appearance to Him is so impressive,
and He has such a sense of her dignity, grace, and majesty, that it is
as if He sees an army advancing toward Him waving its banners. It stirs
up great respect and love for her, but from one that was an enemy it would
cause terror. Her glances filled with love slay Him -- overcome Him --
because His banner over her is love (S.O.S. 2:4, 6:4-5). Her beauty, splendor,
and glory surpass even all the spiritual host of heaven -- the morning,
the moon, and the sun (S.O.S. 6:10).

<P>Oh, how blessed we are to have such a Husband, such a Lord. We are members
of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. We have become one as doves.
They mate for life (Eph. 5:23-31).

<P>Doves are not as carrion birds that feed on the rubbish of the world.
When doves soar aloft in the air, they are always looking for their dovecote,
and when they see it, they fly with great speed to it. It is their delight.
This is because they have only one heart -- they are single-hearted. God
has made them this way (Jer. 32:39, Eph. 6:5).

<P>There is no separation in the body of a dove. When one is wounded all
the body feels the pain (Isa. 63:9, Rom. 12:15).

<P>Is our body doing as our "Head" desires? If it isn't, this is called
convulsion, and is a sign of serious illness.

<P>Oh, may we seek the Lord daily for his grace to be more true to our
name. May we have eyes that are always looking towards "home" with great
joy and expectation because we are HIS DOVE.</TD>
