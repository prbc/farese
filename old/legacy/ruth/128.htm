<center><font size=+2>HIS LITTLE SANCTUARY&nbsp;</font>
<br><i><font size=+1>(Ezek. 11:16)&nbsp;</font></i>
<br><i><font size=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</font></i></center>

<p>"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord God: "Although I have cast them
far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the
countries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries
where they have gone."'&nbsp;
<p>Oh, what words of comfort to our souls these words of Ezekiel should
be.&nbsp;
<p>God's people were being treated and spoken to with very unkind and cruel
words; words that cut to the heart. I am sure that most of us have experienced
this same thing at times; it is a very bitter experience. At these times
our dear Lord gives us words of encouragement, and comfort, and says to
all that feel that nobody cares, that nobody loves them, "I will be a little
sanctuary to you."&nbsp;
<p>Let us consider what these precious words could, and will be to us if
we believe in the goodness and faithfulness of our God.&nbsp;
<p>The beautiful temple that Solomon built was situated upon Mount Zion.
When the tribes were carried away as captives they could not carry their
beautiful place of worship with them. But now God sends a word of great
mercy to them in their great sorrow. He says, "I will be a little sanctuary
to you." I, Myself, will be a holy place to you; wherever you are, and
wherever you go; I can be a place of worship for you. Wherever we seek
Him, He can be found, and every place can be hallowed ground.&nbsp;
<p>Jacob found this to be true when he laid his head down to sleep in the
wilderness and woke up and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none
other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" (Gen. 28:17).&nbsp;
<p>The Lord, Himself, is the temple of His people, in heaven, as well as
on earth (Rev. 21:22). As we enter into this Holy Place, into the Holy
of Holies, we will find all that we want and all that we need. Our spirits
may be troubled and our insides torn apart for one reason or another, but
as we enter into the Holy of Holies there is absolute silence. (There was
never a sound heard in the Holy of Holies - only the smoke of the incense
quietly ascended up to God giving off a sweet smelling odor and God's presence
hovered over the mercy seat.)&nbsp;
<p>Here is God waiting to forgive, to comfort, to strengthen, granting
peace and rest, and filling the soul with joy.&nbsp;
<p>Thank you Lord for all your precious gifts and grace.&nbsp;</td>
