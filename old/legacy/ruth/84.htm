<p>"As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters" (S. O. S.
2:2).
<p>The Lord calls us His lilies; we are as He is (S.O.S. 2:1).&nbsp; He
sees our beauty and it ravishes His heart; He delights to be among us,
and His nostrils smell a sweetness like no other, even though we are surrounded
by thorns (S.O.S. 4:9-11).
<p>The Lord says, "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow" (Matt.
6:28).&nbsp; Let us do that for our encouragement, comfort, growth in grace,
and holiness of life.
<p>The lilies in the east grow among thorns in the valleys.&nbsp; Thorns
are very ugly in appearance and always cause pain when they pierce the
skin; at times even ripping and tearing it, causing great wounds.
<p>Look at how they pierced the Lord's head, hands, feet, and heart; yet
see how lovely, how beautiful he grew.&nbsp; Never was a lily adorned like
our Lord.&nbsp; He grew to be so beautiful because He used the pain of
the thorns to bring out the beauty that was within Him for all to see -
the perfection and glory of God.
<p>He was called the "Lily of the Valley" because He manifested the nature
of a lily; He was self-propagating.&nbsp; (The root of the lily often produces
fifty bulbs.)&nbsp; Oh, what a Lily our Lord is!&nbsp; He has produced
an innumerable number of lilies to the glory of God.
<p>The bulbs of lilies have to be cut into, ripped apart, uprooted, and
laid aside for awhile to propagate them until the time of planting comes.&nbsp;
<p>God has placed us among the thorns of this world as the Lord was.&nbsp;
May we not fight against His working lest we return to our natural state
and produce only thorns and thistles. Let us take heed to Luther's words.&nbsp;
"If you are the lily and the rose of Christ, know that your dwelling place
is among thorns.&nbsp; Only take heed lest by impatience, rash judgments,
and pride, you yourself become a thorn."
<p>Sometimes the Lord picks His lilies when they are in full bloom, still
very young (S.O.S. 6:2).&nbsp; Other times He leaves them until they are
very old and withered; but even then they are very useful and beautiful
in His sight.&nbsp; (The white lily plant was used as fuel when it was
withered, and may still be.)
<p>Let us be fuel to warm those around us, and sweeten their lives with
the fragrance of Christ.&nbsp; Let us burn joyfully!!!&nbsp; We will, we
can, because our master Gardener has said, "He shall grow as the lily,
and cast forth his roots as Lebanon" (Hos. 14:5).&nbsp;&nbsp; Make it so
Lord, even now, for the glory of your&nbsp;
