<p>Dear Christian, have you been wondering why you have so many burdens in your life?  Could it be that the Lord is making up His pillars for His temple?

<p>"He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more.  I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God.  And I will write on him My new name."

<p>Pillars were things of beauty many years ago with many works of art engraved into them, but they were also for support - for bearing burdens. 

<p>When Solomon built the temple of God he placed two beautifully decorated pillars of brass by the vestibule of the temple   The tops of them were in the shape of lilies; the one on the right was named Jachin, which means "He will establish" and the one on the left was named Boaz which means "in Him is strength" (II Ch. 3:15-17, 4:12-13, I Kgs. 7:13-22).  These particular pillars were not used to bear any burden, but only reminders to the worshippers to always depend upon God for strength and stability.
<p>
    When God's people were in the wilderness fleeing from the Egyptians the Lord manifested Himself to them as a pillar of cloud; He went before them to guide them and behind them to protect them.  This pillar was a cloud of darkness to the Egyptians, but to the Israelites it was a pillar of light (Ex.14:19-20).

<p>Oh, the weight that this "Pillar" had to bear for years as the people passed through the wilderness!  Oh, the weight that He must be bearing now as we are passing through this wilderness!  But let us not be discouraged; let us continually look at those two pillars that were in the temple - strength and stability - and know that they are ours in Jesus Christ.

<p>Let us now show ourselves to be "His pillars" not to just decorate His house, His temple, but to manifest His name to a lost world by bearing burdens as He bore all of ours (Isa. 53:11, Acts 9:15).

<p>Let us bear the burdens of our weaker brethren with gentleness, meekness, and love, as the Lord bears with us, remembering always that it is only He that has made us to differ (I Cor. 4:7).  Then we shall with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 15:1-7).
