<P>God willing, I will be writing articles on our Good Shepherd and His
sheep for the next few months, using Psalm 23 for the foundational truth.
Let's begin with His sheep and why He calls us "His sheep."&nbsp;

<P>The life of sheep depends totally on their shepherd. They are unable
by nature to take care of themselves or protect themselves; they can only
run in time of danger. Sheep are gentle, feeble, timid, dumb, harmless,
and helpless; they won't rest unless they are free from fear.&nbsp;

<P>The first thing the shepherd does when he buys his sheep is mark them.
A mark has to be cut in their ear with a sharp knife to establish ownership.
This is painful for the sheep, but the Good Shepherd understands their
pain. He had to pay a dear price to buy these sheep, and was marked, Himself,
in His hands and feet (Jn. 20:27).&nbsp;

<P>All these sheep were sheep that had gone astray; sheep that would have
died in the wilderness if the Good Shepherd hadn't gone after them (Isa.
53:6). They used to belong to a cruel owner who had a "hired man" to watch
over them, but he didn't have any love for the sheep; so when the wolves,
bears, or coyotes came, he would just run off and leave them to be torn
apart, or killed (Jn. 10:12-13). When the Good Shepherd saw this, He had
mercy on these sheep, loved them, and gave all that He had to buy them.
The original owner didn't want to give them up at first, and there was
a terrible battle, but in the end the Good Shepherd won, and now these
sheep are His forever (Gen. 3:15, Jn. 10:28).&nbsp;

<P>At first though, these sheep didn't want to come to this Good Shepherd;
their former owner had great power over them and had blinded them to His
goodness (II Cor. 4:4). But the Good Shepherd had all power in heaven and
earth; so in the day of His power He made them willing to come to Him (Jn.
5:40, Matt:28:18, Psa. 110:3). Now they are free from all fear; free from
all that would harm them (II Tim. 1:7, I Jn. 4:18). Now they can rest (Matt.
11:28).&nbsp;

<P>Dear reader, have you experienced this change of ownership? Have you
been made to realize your bondage to sin, and your blindness to it (Jn.
8:34:36)? If not, call out to the Good Shepherd; let Him know that you
want to come home. He is still looking for His stray sheep; you will not
have to live in fear anymore.

<P>&nbsp;Oh Shepherd of Israel, we Your sheep, Your flock, thank You. You
have delivered us out of the hands of the evil one; you have broken the
bands of our yoke and set us free. We enter most gladly into Your covenant
of peace. We are so thankful that, even now, we can dwell safely in this
wilderness without fear. We will sleep quietly even in the dark woods (Ezek.
34:23-31). Blessed be Your Name!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
