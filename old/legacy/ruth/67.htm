<P>"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever" (Psa. 23:6).

<P>When I was young I married a soldier, and we moved about continually
for one reason or another. It was a very difficult time for me. I used
to think how good it would be if I could stay in one house for the rest
of my life.&nbsp;

<P>Well, I have found such a house, as David did. Let me tell you about
it. Once you see it you will want to live in it for the rest of your life
also (I Ch. 17:7-14).

<P>This house is built by the living God. He chose the material, and prepared
to build it before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4). He laid the
foundation for it, and made it of living stones; all of them precious in
His sight, He alone being the chief cornerstone (I Pet. 2:4-6).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, how He worked to build this house! It was such hard labor that He
sweat blood (Lk. 22:44). He worked so hard to make it perfect, and long-lasting
that it finally killed Him. But praise the Lord, He arose from the dead,
and now keeps this house, and is continually adding new stones to it.

<P>He calls us now to be fellow-workers with Him; to build up the house
of God, but warns us to take heed how we build (I Cor. 3:9-11).

<P>If we want to build well we must build with the treasures (the spoils)
that we have won in our spiritual battles (I Ch. 26:27), treasures of gold,
silver, and precious stones. These are such things as a deeper knowledge
of God, of self, and of how to walk with God. This material will withstand
the fire of testing; not as wood, hay, or straw (I Cor. 3:12-13).

<P>Our sufferings are not in vain. They are to enable us to build the house
of God to the glory of His name. What a privilege! What a purpose! What
a plan! May we follow it faithfully.

<P>Our God has come to make HIS HOME in our heart, to live in it forever
(Jn. 14:23). Because He has it will become a place of love, joy, and peace;
a place of perfect rest. It is what all our homes should be, and what we
hope they will be by His grace.

<P>To you who have not found "this house" yet, please keep looking for
it, because once you find it, you will never want to move out. It is furnished
with such great riches that it will take you all eternity to spend them.
You will be abundantly satisfied with the fullness and goodness of this
house (Psa. 36:8, 65:4). It is so magnificent, so glorious, that the Lord
calls it a MANSION. He is there, now, preparing it for our arrival (Jn.
14:2-3).

<P>Oh Lord, we Your sheep say with David, "Who are we that You should build
us such a house; who are we that we should be so honored to dwell with
You forever?" We thank You; we bless You. We will still be praising You
forever, and forever. Blessed are those who dwell in Your house (Psa. 84:4).&nbsp;&nbsp;
