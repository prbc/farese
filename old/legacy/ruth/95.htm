<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tamping is the process of firming down the
seed into the soil with the back of a rake to ensure that the seed comes
into close contact with the soil and will be without any air pockets.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you are a new Christian and you are
wondering why so many unpleasant things have been happening to you.&nbsp;
Don't wonder anymore.&nbsp; It is your faithful Master Gardener ensuring
that His seed will grow well.&nbsp; His compassion is new every morning
(Lam. 3:22-23).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tamping is to press you closer and closer
to Him, and surely that is what we pray for and what we desire.&nbsp; We
have a problem with the painful things in our lives only because we don't
understand or see, how good , how wise, how needful, and how loving this
all is for us at the time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord knows all His plants perfectly.&nbsp;
He has made them.&nbsp; He not only made them once, but re-made them again,
and had to pay a great price to do it (II Cor. 5:15).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some require more tamping than others.&nbsp;
They have a nature that keeps pulling away from the soil, wanting to live
independently from it.&nbsp; But that would be death to the plant, so He
can't allow that to happen no matter how much the blows of the rake may
hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, may we come to learn, and believe, that
all this pain is for our sakes in order to make us into a beautiful fruit-bearing
tree to God's glory (II Cor. 4:15).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All things are of God (II Cor. 5:18).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us thank Him and praise Him for His continued
goodness towards us!!!&nbsp;</td>
