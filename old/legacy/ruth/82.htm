<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
places in Christ: According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the
glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved" (Eph.
1:3-6).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Master Gardener had a plan before the foundation
of the world.&nbsp; He would make a beautiful garden for Himself, and put
in it all that was beautiful and pleasant to His eyes, giving Him great
delight.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He chose His plants from every nation, of every
color, every size, and every kind (Rom. 1:5).&nbsp; He decided what place
they would have in His garden and the work that they were to do (Eph. 4:11-13).&nbsp;
Some were given special jobs as those listed in Ephesians, but all were,
and are, given the work of making His garden beautiful and trying to influence
others to come and live in His garden also (Matt. 28:19-20, I Pet. 1:15-16).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we see this as a special privilege given
to us, for surely it is. We are laborers together with God.&nbsp; One plants
and another waters, but it is God, only, that can give the increase (I
Cor 3:6-9).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us be eager to go out into this wilderness
and find some of the Lord's plants, praying that the Holy Spirit will make
it a fruitful field (Isa. 32:15).&nbsp; We are to sow the seed (the word
of God) everywhere we are, and everywhere we go. If we do this, the Lord
has promised to bless us so greatly that the "corn" shall come up so thickly
that He shall have to turn even the ox and ass into it to eat the tops
off it to keep it under control (Isa. 32:20).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Lord, we are poor and needy.&nbsp; Open
rivers and fountains for us; make this wilderness a pool of water, and
plant your trees to the glory of your name (Isa. 41:17-20).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we, as workers together with You, not receive
the grace of God in vain (II Cor. 6:1).&nbsp;</td>
