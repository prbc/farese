<center><b><font size=+2>HIS MEETING PLACE</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>by R.T. Holmes</font></i></center>

<p>All lovers have a place where they love to meet and enjoy each other’s
company, and so it is with the Lord. He loved His Father from all eternity
and loved to meet with Him while He was upon the earth. We see Him meeting
with Him at all times of the day and night (Lk. 6:12).
<p>But the Lord had another loved one - the love of His life - His people.
He calls us to come and meet with Him at the mountain of myrrh until the
day breaks - until our Morning Star comes, and there is no more night (S.O.S.
4:6). This mountain of myrrh and frankincense is the place where the Lord
has established His mercy seat, the throne of grace. He may always be found
there; it is HIS HOLY MOUNTAIN where He will make us joyful (Heb. 4:16,
Isa. 56:7).
<p>It is called a mountain in the Song of Solomon because it was on Mount
Moriah that God met with His ancient people. It was a place where the Lord
went often to pray. It was a place apart from the business of the world.
<p>The Lord desires greatly to see us and to hear our voice. He says, "O
my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret places of the cliff,
Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet,
and your face is lovely" (S.O.S. 2:14). Nothing is more pleasing to the
Lord than to hear His dove - His beloved - not only singing, but seeking
grace to be more holy, more conformed to His image, confessing her sin,
mourning over lack of closeness to Him, finding all her needs met in Him.
<p>Oh, what encouragement to prayer these verses in Song of Solomon should
be for us. He sees us as all fair, without spot (4:7). Though we are unworthy
in our own eyes, He sees us clothed in His glorious righteousness and sees
nothing but beauty.
<p>The Lord’s heart is enraptured with affection for us (4:9). He will
not love us any better in heaven than He loves us now. His love cannot
increase or decrease; He is unchangeable. The origin and strength of His
love are entirely apart, and independent, of anything in us or from us.
He is always ready to receive us at the throne of grace. Our love for Him,
and its fruit, is more beautiful to His mind than we can now understand
(4:10).
<p>Moral beauty is more glorious than material beauty. The former is the
life and perfection of the latter. Love is the crown of moral excellence
and the glory of God - the sum of all His perfections. Love in the believer
is the image of the love of God that the Holy Spirit is forming there.
Even though our love is still amid much corruption and infirmities, the
Lord still looks on it with delight.
<p>Oh, may these verses from the Song of Solomon cause our hearts to burn
with love for our Beloved, and give us a greater desire to spend more time
<u>alone</u> <u>with</u> <u>just</u> <u>Him</u>.
<p>Oh Lord, enlarge our hearts so that we may not only run, but fly - fly
to our mountain, our Rock. We will if we always remember Your promises,
trusting in You to be faithful to Your word, and seeking the help of Your
Spirit (Psa. 124:6-8).
<p>FLY TO YOUR MOUNTAIN, DOVE OF THE LORD!!</td>
