<P>"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life"
(Psa. 23:6).

<P>This verse is speaking about the shepherd, not the sheep. But sheep
can leave goodness behind them also. Their manure is the best balanced
of any produced by domestic stock. It is of enormous benefit to the soil
if scattered efficiently. Sheep also eat all sorts of weeds and undesirable
plants which might otherwise invade a field. In a few years a flock of
well-managed sheep can clean up and restore a piece of ravaged land as
no other animal can. Sheep will only do this though, if they have a good
shepherd; one that is intelligent, wise, loving, and caring..

<P>Such is our Shepherd without doubt. Not only goodness will follow us
all the lays of our lives, but mercy as well.

<P>Why was David <U>so</U> <U>sure</U>? It was because he knew his Shepherd.
He had lived in close contact with him for years. He had met all his needs.
He had proven Himself to be Faithful and True.

<P>He had killed all his enemies (Rom. 3:24-25). He had made him able to
be at peace with all men - even the "bossy ewes" (Prov. 16:7). He had healed
all his diseases (Psa. 103:3). He had provided abundance of food, and drink,
and it was all free (Isa. 55:l).

<P>Oh, sheep of the Lord - know how blessed you are!!!

<P>You were chosen by Him (Jn. 15:16), sought by Him (Ezek. 34:11), drawn
by Him (Hos. 11:4), saved by Him (Jn. 10:27-28), bought by Him (Acts 20:28),
fought for by Him (Lk. 1:74), preserved and protected by Him (Jn. 17:12,
15), strengthened by Him (Phil. 1:6), loved by Him (Jn. 15:9), corrected
by Him (Jn. 15:2), sanctified by Him (I Th. 5:23-24), avenged by Him (Matt.
18:6), heard by Him (Jn. 16:23-24), led by Him (Jn. 16:13-14), taught by
Him (Isa. 54:13), and built a house by Him; ruled by Him forever (Heb.
3:6).&nbsp;

<P>WHAT MORE COULD ANYONE WANT???

<P>Let us prove ourselves to be His well-managed sheep to the glory of
His name by leaving goodness behind us also; goodness that will make this
desert land a garden of the Lord.&nbsp;
