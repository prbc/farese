<center><b><font size=+1>HIS FERTILIZER</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grace to you, and peace from God our Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 1:7).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All plants need some fertilizer every so often
as there are many pests and diseases that will weaken and kill the plants
if they are left to themselves.&nbsp; Fertilizer is not medicine; it is&nbsp;
food to improve the quality or quantity of plant growth.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the Lord's plants are not very vigorous
so He has to use what is called a "root feeder."&nbsp; It is a tool that
injects fertilizer deep into the soil.&nbsp; All the Lord's plants would
have died if He hadn't made a very special fertilizer for them to ensure
their life and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fertilizer is called grace, and He made
it up with His sufferings and death (Heb. 2:10, 5:8-9).&nbsp; It is such
a powerful fertilizer that it always kills the "bugs and diseases" that&nbsp;
<br>would kill His plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His root feeder is suffering - suffering of
any kind - and it is made up for our profit and growth (Heb. 12:10-11).&nbsp;
It is His gift to us (Phil. 1:29).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us stop poisoning our souls with this precious
gift.&nbsp; If fertilizer isn't mixed with water it will burn up the plants
and so will our Lord's gift if it isn't mixed with the water of His word
- His precious promises, believed, tried, and proven by our lives (Rom.
8:28, II Cor. 2:15).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has purposed suffering to kill suffering
forever.&nbsp; See the truth in the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It is the
blessing of the new covenant given to us to enable us to manifest His great
glory (II Cor. 4:10-12).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not lose heart.&nbsp; Following our
Lord will always lead to glory, here and hereafter, as we look not at the
things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen (II Cor. 4:16-18).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Lord, open our eyes and enable us to behold
more of Your glory!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
