<center><b><font size=+1>HIS PRUNING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit
he taketh away;&nbsp; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it,
that it may bring forth more fruit" (Jn. 15:2).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pruning is a painful process for a tree as
well as for us.&nbsp; Sharp instruments have to be used such as pruners,
shears, saws, or knives; all speak of pain .
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me tell you why, when, and where plants
must be pruned.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Plants and trees must be pruned
to produce heavy growth.&nbsp; Regular pruning makes them stronger and
more able to resist the high winds, snow damage, and ice storms. Without
pruning many can become diseased or overcrowded, stunting their growth.&nbsp;
Fruit and nut trees require more pruning than those that don't bear fruit.&nbsp;
If they are not pruned the fruit will be much smaller and not fully colored;
its lack of sunlight from not being pruned causes some of the buds to wither
and die.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When?&nbsp; Knowing when one should prune depends
on the kind of tree, the size wanted, and the fruit that it is to bear.&nbsp;
Some are pruned in the spring, some are pruned in the summer, and some
in the winter; but all must be pruned or they will finally become diseased
and die.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; Some need their roots pruned;
some need to be thinned out; some need dead or diseased branches or limbs
cut off; some need to be notched or bark-ringed all around their trunk
with a pruning knife to cure unwanted growth and increase their vigor and
a greater fruit set.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not complain or murmur against our Master
Gardener's pruning.&nbsp; He does this in love so that we shall not die.&nbsp;
Let us not fear it, either.&nbsp; The action of any wounded plant is to
reproduce.&nbsp; The Lord does not make any mistakes in His work.&nbsp;
He knows just why, when, and where to prune to produce the fruit that we
are lacking to make us just like Himself.&nbsp; Our wounds are to send
us continually back to Him, to behold His glory, that we might be changed
into His image (II Cor. 3:18).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Christian, if you are feeling the knife,
the saw, or even the chain saw cutting you back even to the stump, ask
your Lord to search you, and try you, that you might know what is in your
heart (Psa. 139:23-24).&nbsp; If no enlightenment comes, wait on Him and
for Him.&nbsp; Believe His promises.&nbsp; He will give grace and glory.&nbsp;
No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.&nbsp; The
"Sun" will shine (Psa. 84:11).&nbsp; Look for it!</td>
