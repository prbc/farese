<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS GIVING (Matt. 10:8)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Holmes&nbsp;</FONT></I></CENTER>


<P>The Lord says, "Freely ye have received, freely give." Let us not think
of what He gives, but rather at how He gives.&nbsp;

<P>At Christmas time many people talk about "having the Christmas spirit."
Let us take a look at what that really is.&nbsp;

<P>The Lord gives: indiscriminately - to all kinds, rich or poor, to all
races, to all nations, to whosoever may come, and take the water of life
freely (Rev. 22:17). Undeservedly - Surely those that continually sin,
that show hatred of God by disobedience and lack of concern for His glory,
surely they deserve nothing but His just wrath. Unexpectedly - Who could
expect such mercy, such love, such kindness from One who had been treated
so badly by them? Lovingly - Who has ever seen such love; love that will
suffer long, year after year , and still continue to give the person good
things even though he, or she, is evil (Matt. 26:50). Willingly - The Lord
considered the doing of the will of the Father as necessary to Him, and
pleasant, as eating (Jn. 4:34). Gladly - This is why He did it with great
delight as David (Psa. 40:8). No other giving is acceptable to God (Deut.
28:47-48). Constantly - The Lord was always giving of His time, energies,
gifts, and graces. Freely - This does not mean just without cost, but a
giving without a condition in the receiver (Rom. 3:24-26, Rev. 22:17),
a giving, expecting nothing in return (Lk. 6:35). Secretly - The Lord does
not boast or brag about His giving, but only gives glory to God. He works
secretly in the soul, and His giving is only known by its fruits in the
life of the person (Gal. 5:22-23). Richly - He gives life, justification,
sanctification, forgiveness of sins, wisdom, understanding, power, love,
joy, peace, comfort, grace, and glory - all things. What price could one
put on these things? They are priceless. Completely - The Lord held nothing
back. He gave Himself completely and totally for us, even unto death (Rom.
5:8-10).&nbsp;

<P>As you and I examine our giving it will be easy to see how far short
we come in comparison. But let us not be discouraged. Let us seek grace
from the Lord to give as He gives, more and more.&nbsp;

<P>May we have a heart like David's who could say truthfully, "Neither
will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which does cost
me nothing" (II Sam. 24:24).&nbsp;

<P>May we really have the "Christmas spirit" this year.&nbsp;</TD>
