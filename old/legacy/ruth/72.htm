<P>The eldest son in all the families of Israel was regarded as sacred to God because Israel's firstborn were exempted from the stroke which destroyed all the firstborn of Egypt on the first Passover night.  The firstborn represented the whole people.
<P>
The Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten of the Father came into the world as the Firstborn over all creation; by Him all things were created - through Him and for Him.  He is the Heir of all things (Jn. 1:14, 18, Col. 1:15-16, Heb. 1:2).  Because He is, and we are in Him, we have a title now to the future fullness of the inheritance that was purchased for all the children of God by Christ Jesus.  The whole weight of glory that is prepared for us is called "the inheritance of the saints in the light" (Col. 1:12).  The riches of this glory is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27).  
<P>
We are now heirs of the same promise that was made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Gal. 3:29, Heb. 6:17-20).  It contains a deliverance from all evil, which the guilt of sin and dominion of Satan has brought upon us, and the bestowing of all spiritual blessings in heavenly things.  It is called an eternal inheritance (Heb. 9:15).  We are heirs of righteousness; righteousness which is by faith (Heb. 11:7).  Peter calls it "being heirs of the grace of life" (I Pet. 3:7).  We are heirs of salvation; an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for us (Heb. 1:14, I Pet. 1:4).
<P>
We have all this because God, the Father, gave His Son an inheritance, and God's people are His inheritance (Jn. 17:6, 10).
<P>
OH, THE RICHES OF THE GLORY OF HIS INHERITANCE IN THE SAINTS!  We are His vessels of mercy and He keeps working all things for our sakes, working in our souls, making them glorious within (Rom.9:23-24,  II Cor. 4:15-17,  Psa. 45:13).
<P>
Oh Christian, bring your vessel to the Fountain of Living Waters; fill it full of the riches of His glory by overcoming evil with good.  Then you shall be able to say with Paul, "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Rom. 8:18, Jer. 17:13, Rev. 21:6-7).
<P>
"Save your people (Lord) and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them also and bear them up forever" (Psa. 28:9).
<P>
