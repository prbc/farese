<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS PRESENCE (EZEKIEL 48:35)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>What a glorious truth is the omnipresence of God! There is no place
where He is not present.&nbsp;

<P>If we ascend into heaven, He is there. If we descend into hell, He is
there. On land, in the sea, in light, in darkness He is there (Psa. 139:8-12).
His name is Jehovah-Shammah, which means THE LORD, THERE.&nbsp;

<P>Oh Christian, ask God to write this name, His name, on your heart, and
you will discover that you can live in the fire of affliction and not be
burned. You will not even have the smell of smoke on you.&nbsp;

<P>The apostle Paul said, "For in Him we live, and move, and have our being"
(Acts 17:28). God preserves and sustains all, but God manifests Himself
differently to His people than to others. He is the Lover of their souls.&nbsp;

<P>In your deepest sorrow, in your pain, in your loss, SEE THE LORD, THERE
with you as a lover, holding your hand, leading you, guiding you through
this wilderness to glory (Psa.. 73:23-24). Oh what joy! Trust Him, believe
Him. He says, "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest"
(Ex. 33:14). "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb.13:5). What
is there to fear? He will not fail you as others. His name is Faithful
and True (Rev. 19:11).&nbsp;

<P>Let us not be as Job in our affliction who said, "He goes by me and
I see Him not." This is why he was filled with bitterness (Job 9:11-18).
He did not see his God as a lover constantly with him in His goodness and
grace.&nbsp;

<P>Let us pray for eyes to always see the Lord in our way. He is ALWAYS
THERE. But we will only be able to trust Him immovably, and wait patiently,
if we are inwardly persuaded of His continual presence with us for good.&nbsp;

<P>For you who still do not know this great and glorious God, His word
to you is still the same as Paul preached in Athens many centuries ago.
He commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day
in which He will judge the world by Jesus Christ, the Lord (Acts 17:30-31).
May you see your need while there is yet time.&nbsp;
