<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS POVERTY (II Cor. 8:9)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>Poverty is never a very pleasant state. It always speaks of great need,
suffering, and sometimes death. We see countries in Asia with millions
of people dying of starvation because they are so poor. It is a heartbreaking
sight.&nbsp;

<P>Yet we see our Lord, whose riches are unsearchable, becoming poor for
our sakes, so that we might be rich. He lived His whole life making Himself
poor, spending and being spent to enrich His fellow men, giving His time,
taking the trouble to go out of His way to meet their need, and ours, with
care, with compassion, and with concern. He was always doing good to others,
not just His friends, but also His enemies, even those that murdered Him.
His thoughts, even in the midst of extreme agony are for the good of others.
His first words from the cross are, "Father, forgive them for they know
not what they do" (Lk. 23:34).&nbsp;

<P>We have looked at "how" the Lord gave. Now let us look at "what" He
gave so that we might see what it means, spiritually, and truly, to give
freely.&nbsp;

<P>Look at the cross. See this One who was God, as well as man, stripped
of all He had. He was God the Son, the Sovereign Ruler and Creator over
all things in heaven and earth (Jn. 1:1). Now He gives up all His rights,
and puts Himself under the power and authority of men. He was stripped
of all comfort, all possessions, all honor, all friends, all loved ones,
of life - for your sake and for mine, that we through His poverty might
be rich.&nbsp;

<P>This is the "Christmas spirit." Is it yours? Is it mine? If not, God
says to you, "You must be born again" (Jn. 3:5-7). One cannot begin to
have such a spirit unless the Lord has given him His life and His love.
But even if He has, as we look at the Lord we see the covetousness that
still dwells in us, and we struggle to forsake all for His sake (Lk. 14:33).&nbsp;

<P>May God grant unto each one of us grace to live as our Lord lived, making
ourselves poor, spending and being spent, doing good to others, not only
to our friends, but also to our enemies, to the glory of His precious name.
But let us not have "this spirit" for just one day. Let us try to have
it every day of the year - every day that the Lord leaves us here to be
"salt" and "light" to an evil world.&nbsp;

<P>Let us lay up for Him all the fruits of our love as He has laid up for
us (S.O.S. 7:13). All His desire is towards us (S.O.S. 7:10). May ours
be towards Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
