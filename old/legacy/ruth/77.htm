<center><b><font size=+1>THE FATHER'S PLANTS</font></b>
<br><i><font size=+1>By R. T. Holmes&nbsp;</font></i></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According as he hath chosen us in him before
the foundation of the world" - (Eph. 1:4).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, look with me now at the beauty, the glory,
and the imperishability of the Father's plants.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, the Father, chose His plants before the
creation of the world (Eph. 1:4-6).&nbsp; It was His purpose and plan to
have a people to the praise of His glory.&nbsp; He gave these people -
these plants - to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to plant and care for
so that they would never die (Jn. 17:2).&nbsp; The Lord was faithful and
successful in His great work because He had faith in His Father that He
would give Him, and do for Him, all that was necessary to keep these plants
alive.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Lord nears the end of His life on earth,
we see how He did it.&nbsp; He was completely dependent on His Father all
of His life to meet all of His needs.&nbsp; He could do nothing (as a man)
without His father (Jn. 5:19, 30).&nbsp; This is why He prayed so often
to His Father.&nbsp; All human life must recognize its dependency upon
God or it will surely die, not only once, but twice (Jude 12-13).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many today are teaching God's plants that God
can't do all that is necessary to save them unless they "let Him."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a plant give itself life? Can it keep itself
alive?&nbsp; Is the plant more powerful than the God that made it? If it
is, we don't need any more gardeners!!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are making their faith, and their will,
their savior. It is faith in Him - in the Master Gardener - that will save
us.&nbsp; We can do nothing - nothing without Him&nbsp; (Jn. 15:5).&nbsp;
If we believe the truth, we will always be praying for Him to do for us
what we can't do for ourselves.&nbsp; We will be asking Him to give us
grace, wisdom, power, love, life, etc., according to His promises.&nbsp;
It is by grace that all are saved through faith - and not of ourselves
(Eph. 2:8).&nbsp; It is faith in Him, in His promises to justify and sanctify
us, wholly (Acts 13:38-39, II Th. 5:23-24).&nbsp; It is because of His
faithfulness to His word that we are not consumed (Lam. 3:22-23, Jn. 17:
11, 17).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us read Psalm 119 over and over again.&nbsp;
It will teach us how to live, and how to pray, so that we won't be dishonoring
the precious name of our Master Gardener.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Reader, are you without Christ - without
hope - on this Christmas Day?&nbsp; Won't you come and rest under His Christmas
Tree and take all His gifts, freely?&nbsp; Why will you die???</td>
