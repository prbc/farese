<P>Dear Christian, are you weary and faint from the war against sin, from
the trials and temptations of this life? Come with me then, and take a
look at the "BED" upon which you can find perfect rest.&nbsp;

<P>As we had no resting place in this world after the covenant of works
was broken, so the Lord had no resting place either. God made a new covenant
then in His Son, and set His love upon a people to be His own. He calls
them "Zion" and "The City of the Lord" (Psa. 132:13-14, Isa. 60:14, 62:12)
This is His resting place (His bed) forever.&nbsp;

<P>It is HIS BED because He made it Himself of the most precious materials
He could find. The wood is the best cedar from Lebanon, long lasting, and
never eaten by worms. The pillars are made of silver (redemption), the
bottom of gold (deity), the covering is of purple (the color of kings),
and all is paved with love.&nbsp;

<P>This BED is now OUR BED and He says it is green -- green because it
is a "Living Bed" - an eternal place of rest (S.O.S. 1:16). He tells us
now to BEHOLD HIS BED.&nbsp;

<P>See how safe and strong it is. Sixty men are carrying it on their shoulders
and protecting it as it passes on to its destination. It is a picture of
the great strength and love of our Beloved (the Lord Jesus Christ) as He
carries us on His shoulders to our Heavenly Home (Deut. 33:12).&nbsp;

<P>He has made THIS BED for you. He rejoices over you with such great joy
that it causes Him to sing, and now rests in His love for you (Zeph. 3:17).&nbsp;

<P>Surely here is a reason why we can rejoice in the Lord always, regardless
of our afflictions.&nbsp;

<P>Let us enter into this rest (sleep on this bed) daily (Heb. 4:1-11).
You will be strengthened for the war if you do.&nbsp;

<P>When we come together on the Lord's Day - the day He finished His work
of redemption - let us sing heartily even though our hearts may have much
sorrow in them. This is the Lord's Day of rest, and HIS REST IS GLORIOUS
(Isa. 11:10). He will carry us straight up to glory.&nbsp;
