<P>Paul's desire was to know the Lord more deeply, even the fellowship
of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10). The Lord answered His prayer with many
sufferings (Acts 9:16). He overcame them all to the glory of God, and we
shall also if we always keep in mind the "treasure" that is in us (II Cor.
4:7). It is Christ - the Holy Spirit - God Himself (Col. 1:27). We are
to follow the Lord in His sufferings and death - bearing about in our bodies
the dying of the Lord ( the dying to our own will to do His) that His life
might be lived out in ours, and seen by all, that life might work in them
(II Cor. 4:10-12).&nbsp;

<P>It is our calling to suffer, an honor and privilege given to us by the
Lord (I Pet. 2:21, Phil. 1:29). Paul could glory in his tribulations because
the love of God was given to him by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:3-5). Paul
was receiving the consolation of the Spirit in all his tribulation, and
this carried him to the highest joy, peace, and contentment possible in
this world.&nbsp;

<P>If we aren't receiving the comfort mentioned in II Cor. 1:3-5, there
are three reasons why found in the scripture. We are either grieving, quenching,
or resisting the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30, I Th. 5:19, Acts 7:51).&nbsp;

<P>We quench Him when we don't consider His continual working in us, giving
us grace to will and to do the will of God (Phil. 2:13). We quench Him
when we do not consider Him by faith as the immediate Author of all our
gifts, assistance, and relief, thanking Him accordingly for His love and
kindness towards us.&nbsp;

<P>We resist Him when we do not obey the word as preached to us by His
ministers that have been given gifts by Him for our good.&nbsp;

<P>We are to love the Spirit and worship Him as we do the Father and the
Son. This is the triune God that is our Savior and Redeemer. He, as Christ,
in His own great love and infinite condescension, willingly came forth
from the Father to be our Comforter. A lack of considering His love weakens
our obedience.&nbsp;

<P>We neglect Him, are disobedient and unthankful, yet He continues to
do us good. Let us consider His love more, and we will find more strength,
joy, and peace in our sufferings (Rom. 15:30, II Cor. 6:4-6).&nbsp;

<P>The results of not receiving the comfort and consolation of the Holy
Spirit are these, according to John Owen.&nbsp;

<P>1. Sin will harden us and we will neglect the remedies provided to fight
against it such as prayer, reading and meditating on the word, and public
worship. 2. We will not use afflictions to our profit or faint under them.&nbsp;

<P>3. We will be filled with pride because we bore with our sufferings
in our own strength, which left us without any sweetness received or shown
to others.&nbsp;

<P>4. Prosperity will make us carnal and sensual and we will find our contentment
in the things of the world leaving us weak to face the trials of adversity.&nbsp;

<P>5. The comforts of our relations will separate us from God, and the
loss of them will make our hearts like Nabal's - hard, selfish, angry,
and greedy (I Sam. 25:10-11).&nbsp;

<P>6. The troubles of the church will overwhelm us, and the prosperity
of the church will not be any concern to us.&nbsp;

<P>7. We will not have any wisdom for the Lord's work, peace in any condition,
strength for any duty, success in any trial, joy in any state, comfort
in life, or light in death.&nbsp;

<P>Let us value the consolation of the Spirit. He makes the love of the
Father known to us. Compare that with all the other causes and means of
joy and consolation in this world, and you will discover their emptiness
- its fullness, their nothingness - its being all.&nbsp;

<P>No wonder Paul considered the sufferings of this present time not worthy
to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. If we suffer
with Him we shall also be glorified together (Rom. 8:17-18).&nbsp;

<P>Oh, glorious day!!!&nbsp;</TD>
