<center><b><font size=+1>HIS WAITING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And therefore will the Lord wait, that he
may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may
have mercy upon you; for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all
they that wait for him" (Isa. 30:18).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All gardeners have a period of waiting for
their plants to grow and produce the crop they desire whether it is fruit
trees, vegetables, vineyards, or just beautiful flowers to beautify and
sweeten life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One must learn to wait God's time; it all depends
on Him - the Master Gardener.&nbsp; He must send the light and the rain,
control the temperature and the winds, or all will be in vain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man now can build himself a little "hot house"
and control the light, the watering, and the temperature and produce enough
food for himself to live on.&nbsp; The majority of people in the world
are doing this.&nbsp; But to live eternally, to live abundantly, well-fed,
with the true riches of Christ, demands waiting on, and waiting for, God
to do the work in us and through us that He has purposed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all must learn to wait for Him if we want
to be blessed by Him.&nbsp; There may be some other field we would like
to work in, some other place we would like to go, but He knows and has
planned before we were born what fruit we were to bear to feed Him, as
well as the world around us, and what beauty and fragrance we were to manifest
and give off to beautify and sweeten the world (S.O.S. 4:10-16, Acts 17:26).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His waiting is to prove us, to test us, to
enable us to be what He wants us to be (Ex. 15:25).&nbsp; He waits that
He may be gracious to us so that we will exalt His name for His great mercy
upon us.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though He gives the bread of adversity and
the water of affliction, yet our eyes and our ears will see Him and hear
Him say to us, "This is the way, walk ye in it" (Isa. 30:20-21).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He who has begun a good work in us will perform
it until the day of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:6).&nbsp; Wait for Him!!&nbsp;
You won't be disappointed.</td>
