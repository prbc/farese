<center><b><font size=+1>HIS FRUIT</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
against such there is no law" (Gal. 5:22-23).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord calls His people "a garden" because
they are useful and bear fruit.&nbsp; Their fruit is the medicine that
keeps the whole world from complete corruption.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He delights to walk among them and eat the
pleasant fruits (S.O.S. 6:2-3).&nbsp; As we feed on Him, so He feeds on
the fruit we produce by His Spirit.&nbsp; We have all things in common.&nbsp;
Our fruit is especially sweet to Him because it is produced by His bloody
labor.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a sweetness this can bring to the suffering,
affliction, and persecution in our lives if we realize in it that our Lord
is feeding on the fruit that He is producing in us by His grace.&nbsp;
No wonder the bride calls out in S.O.S. 4:16 and says, "Awake, O north
wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof
may flow out.&nbsp; Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant
fruits" (S.O.S. 4:16).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A north wind is cold; it cuts, freezes, and
kills.&nbsp; A south wind is warm; it encourages growth; it comforts.&nbsp;
She is saying, "Whatever it takes; whatever it costs; come, that I may
feed my Beloved."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May we have such a spirit.&nbsp; May we bring
forth our fruit unto God, rejoicing that we have such a privilege (Rom.
7:4).&nbsp; May it never be said of us, as it was of Israel, "Israel is
an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself……Their heart is divided"
(Hos. 10:1-2).&nbsp; Because it was, his root dried up, and he didn't bear
any fruit (Hos. 9:16).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Lord has left us in His garden to plant,
to sow, and to reap. May we always consider this to be the greatest privilege
of life.&nbsp; We are laborers together with God.&nbsp; May we fill His
garden with the fruit of our lips, knowing that it is He who creates it,
offering up to Him, continually, our heartfelt praises and thanksgiving
for His unspeakable (indescribable) gift (Isa. 57:19, I Cor. 3:9, II Cor.
9:15).</td>
