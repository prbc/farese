<P>The wives of the East are secluded with the greatest care from the public
gaze. They are to be for their lords alone. They do not dislike this, but
rather estimate the degree of their husband’s affections by his watchfulness.
The most flattering name that can be applied to an Eastern lady is <I>the
concealed treasure</I>, <I>the guarded jewel</I>, or <I>the well-watched
angel</I>.

<P>S.O.S. 4:12 says, "A garden enclosed Is my sister, my spouse, A spring
shut up, A fountain sealed." Our souls are to be a fountain of affection,
shut up from the world, for the delight of Him who has redeemed us with
His blood and sealed us with His Holy Spirit.

<P>He dwells in this <I>fountain</I>, and is its Guardian. No one has a
right to our affections but the Lord. We are "hid with Christ in God,"
hid from the world as a spring shut up, a garden enclosed. We are <I>His
concealed treasure</I>, <I>His guarded jewels</I>, and <I>His well-watched
angels</I>. He has made us and we are His (Mal. 3:17). We are the work
of His hands, and even the curve of our thighs are like jewels, or necklaces
as the word could be translated, to Him (S.O.S. 7:1).

<P>In ancient times, these necklaces were handsome, and richly ornamented
with pearls and precious stones, and were a principal part of the dress
of both men and women.

<P>Our Lord is the Pearl of Great Price (Matt. 13:45-46). As the oyster
secretes a substance to cover over the irritation of the sand within, it
becomes a pearl. So our Lord shed His blood and covered over our sin to
make a <I>PRICELESS PEARL</I> to give to us.&nbsp;

<P>May we in all our sufferings seek His grace to cover over the irritation,
or pain within, so that we may make beautiful pearls to present to the
Lord that He may be adorned for His wedding day as He is adorning us (S.O.S.
1:10-11).
