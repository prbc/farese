<center><b><font size=+1>HIS CEDARS</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the
cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted" (Psa. 104:16).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the mountains of Lebanon stand the mighty
cedars that God has planted and they are all full of sap.&nbsp; They are
full of vitality and always green even in the middle of winter.&nbsp; (This
speaks of life, eternal life.)&nbsp; The Master Gardener has planted them
so they have no need of human help.&nbsp; He waters them, keeps them, and
protects them from harm.&nbsp; Their roots grow deep and wide; their flourishing
and majestic condition is the praise and glory of God, alone.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it is with every child of God.&nbsp;
We are His garden; He has planted us Himself and promised us that He would
be as "the dew of Israel" to us and that we "will grow as the lily and
cast forth our roots as Lebanon" (Hos. 14:5).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lily grows fast and well, but it soon fades
and is easily pulled up; therefore God has promised His people that they
shall have the beauty of the lily, and the propagation of the lily, but
their roots will be as the cedars - deeply rooted, hidden underground,
spreading out very widely, not pulled up easily.&nbsp; We must grow down
(humble and meek) if we are to grow up into our Lord's image.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spiritual growth mainly consists in the growth
of the root which is out of sight.&nbsp; The more we depend upon and draw
sap and virtue from our Lord, the more stedfast and resolved we will be
to do His will thereby "casting forth our roots."&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's cedars will never be pulled up and left
to die (Amos 9:15).&nbsp; He is keeping them, preserving them, and protecting
them so that no harm will ever come to them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise the Lord fruitful trees and all cedars
(Psa. 148:9).&nbsp; Away with self-esteem - to God be the glory forever!&nbsp;
Our worth is in Him.&nbsp; We are only His dust, and to dust we shall return
(Gen. 2:7,19).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can break the cedars with one spoken word
(Psa. 29:5).&nbsp; The object of lightening is always the highest tree.&nbsp;
Let us not get too high and mighty or we may hear the words spoken to us
that were spoken to King Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 4:19-37).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation;
the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak" (Matt. 26:41).</td>
