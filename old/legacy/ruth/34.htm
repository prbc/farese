<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HIS PEACE (Jn. 14:27)&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P>If the Lord draws us away with "cords of a man, and bands of love’ into
a wilderness of affliction, loss, ruined hope, and bitter disappointments,
let us realize that this is God’s mercy and wisdom to us to keep us in
the "ark" – in the "Rock" – while the waters of affliction are upon the
earth (Gen. 8:9-12). When the land was dry, the dove flew away and never
returned to her house of safety.

<P>The Lord has placed us in the cleft of the rock to keep us safe and
protect us from all evil (S.O.S. 2:14). He is that Rock which was opened
for us by the lash, the thorns, the nails, and the spear, so that we might
hide ourselves in Him from all our enemies, and from the wrath of God (I
Cor. 10:4). This is where we shall learn much about His comfort (Hos. 2:14).&nbsp;

<P>Doves seek a place to hide from the heat of the day and this is where
they hide for protection. They make their nests there (Jer. 48:28). It
is their home.

<P>The Lord Jesus Christ has given us <U>His</U> peace, not the peace of
the world. The peace of the world is founded on circumstances and external
things. Our peace, as well as His peace, is and was, as He lived as a man,
founded on His God and His word.&nbsp;

<P>The Lord Jesus Christ is <U>our</U> <U>peace</U> (Jn. 16:33, Eph. 2:14-15).
It is a peace of mind and heart. If we trust in Him and keep our mind on
Him – who He is, what He has done, and promises to do for us – we shall
have perfect peace (Isa. 26:3).

<P>The life and soul of all our comfort and peace is found in the promises
of Christ. It is the work of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, to bring these
powerfully to our minds, making them effectual so that our comfort and
peace is not in our circumstances, but in Christ.

<P>Our unbelief flares up when it looks like nothing is happening to change
the situation, and we begin then to lose faith in His word, and in Him.
We must remember that the Holy Spirit, as God, works voluntarily and freely
according to His own will (I Cor. 12:ll). If we believe His word, we shall
have <U>His</U> <U>peace</U> in the worst of times. "And therefore will
the Lord wait, that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore will He
be exalted , that He may have mercy upon you: for the Lord is a God of
judgment: blessed are all they that wait for Him" (Isa. 30:18).

<P>May we come to a state where we can really "count it all joy" when we
fall into these trials and temptations (Jas. 1:2). May we begin today,
to sing with joy, singing His song, even in the storm. He is with us and
says, "Peace be still" (Mk. 4:39).&nbsp;
