<center><b><font size=+1>HIS TREE OF LIFE</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the midst of the street of it, and on either
side of the river, was there the tree of life" - (Rev. 22:2).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God made and planted all the trees of the world
(Psa. 104:16), but He has made one tree that is very special - very costly;
it is one of a kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is His Christmas Tree, and He has made
it for us.&nbsp; Oh, that we all may have eyes to behold its glory - even
today!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God determined to have a tree of life before
the creation of the world (Acts 2:23); He thought of it, and set His heart
upon it.&nbsp; He wanted it to be the most glorious tree ever created.&nbsp;
He purposed to decorate it with the finest gifts that the world would ever
see (Isa. 11:10, Eph. 2:8, 3:8, Jn. 3:16).&nbsp; Then He purposed to give
these gifts to a special people, His people, because He set His love upon
them.&nbsp; They are called "His loved ones" and "His garden" (S. O. S.
4:7, 12).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, the Father, purposed that He and His Son
would work together to make this tree; They were the only ones that could.&nbsp;
You see, all of the trees in the world had contracted a deadly disease
called "sin", and all had died (Eph. 2:1).&nbsp; Now only the Son could
take this disease and kill it in His own body on the tree of death (I Pet.
2:24).&nbsp; Now there could be a new tree, a tree of life, His Christmas
Tree, planted in the world again, so that all could eat of it and live
(Rev. 22:2, 14).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, come one - come all - and see the beautiful
and precious gifts that are hanging on this tree and take them freely;
they are yours for the asking (Isa. 55:1-3).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is rest for your weary soul (Matt. 11:28-30).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is grace and faith, unsearchable riches
for your poverty (II Cor. 8:9).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is love, joy, and peace for your sorrowful
spirit (Rom. 5:l, 5).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is forgiveness for all your sin, to remove
all your guilt (Acts 5:31).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is life, eternal life, for your death
(Jn. 10:28).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is God - your God - who says to you,
"Why will you die" (Ezek. 33:11)?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, dear reader, won't you come to this tree
and receive these precious and priceless gifts for yourself?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spirit and the bride say,&nbsp; "Come&nbsp;
-- and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May the Spirit of God give you eyes to behold
His glory so that you may become "His Garden."&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
