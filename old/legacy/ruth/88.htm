<br><font size=+1>by R. T. Holmes</font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every gardener needs some good tools if he
is to have a flourishing garden.&nbsp; Our Gardener has many, and all are
used to keep His precious plants from dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tools are one-of-a-kind; He is the only
one that has them, and He has written His name on them (Jn. 14:6, 13, I
Tim. 2:5).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is called "love" -&nbsp; the love of God.&nbsp;
It is described in S.O.S. 8:6-7.&nbsp; "…For love is strong as death; ……Many
waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would
give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this love that enables God's people to
overcome the whole world (Jn. 5:4).&nbsp; Nothing can quench the fire of
this love. It was seen in the life and death of our Gardener in all its
beauty and glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this love that was as a spade, or fork,
that had to dig up the earth and loosen it, because our root was so rotten,
and the soil had become so hard, that He had to use this tool to its uttermost
(Ezek. 11:19-20).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another tool is called "faith."&nbsp; This
tool is made so well, and is so strong, that it will never fail.&nbsp;
See the truth in Mark 15:34.&nbsp; Though God, His Father, is forsaking
Him, He still believes that He is His God.&nbsp; It is this faith alone,
His faith, that makes His plants live (Gal. 2:20).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another tool is called "prayer."&nbsp; This
is the tool by which He strengthened Himself for the work.&nbsp; Look at
how He works and prays.&nbsp; Oh, how He sweats.&nbsp; Men that work hard
to earn a living, sweat.&nbsp; But this Man, this Gardener, sweats blood
because this Man, this Gardener, is working for life - eternal life, for
the life of His tender plants (Lk. 22:44).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We read in Lev. 17:11, "For the life of the
flesh is in the blood…….for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for
the soul."&nbsp; So it is sure, that as the blood falls and waters the
ground, it shall bring forth life, for it is the blood of God (Acts 20:28).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glory to His name!!</td>
