<center><b><font size=+1>HIS VISION</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher
of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
God" (Heb. 12:2).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All good gardeners have a vision in their minds
of just what they want in their gardens and where, when, and how they will
plant it.&nbsp; They also have in their minds the beauty, and the usefulness,
of that which they will plant when it grows to its maturity.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord had such a vision.&nbsp; He looked
forward to seeing the beauty, and the glory, and the usefulness of His
garden, and for the joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross.&nbsp;
We must do the same.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord may still be plowing us up, and all
looks bare, black, and ugly, but we must see the vision as He did, and
as well as Habakkuk did, though all was exceedingly dark.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habakkuk knew by faith, and believed that one
day the earth would be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,
so he could say, "Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall
fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there
shall be no herd in the stalls; Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will
joy in the God of my salvation.&nbsp; The Lord God is my strength, and
he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon
mine high places" (Hab. 3:17-19).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the vision and follow the plan of your
Gardener.&nbsp; He says, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for
they are white already to harvest.&nbsp; And he that reapeth receiveth
wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that both he that soweth
and he that reapeth may rejoice together" (Jn. 4:35-36).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you go?&nbsp; Are you prepared?&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, "Where there is no vision, the people
perish" (Prov. 29:18).
