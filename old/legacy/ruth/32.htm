<P>The bible says the Lord’s eyes are "as eyes of doves by the rivers of
waters, washed with milk, and fitly set" (S.O.S. 5:12). He also says of
us, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold thou art fair; thou hast doves’
eyes." He says this not only once, but twice (S.O.S. 1:15, 4:1).&nbsp;

<P>The eyes of doves are very bright, shining and piercing , and always
very moist. They are a tender bird, not one of prey. Eyes of doves by the
rivers of waters, washed with milk and fitly set, speak of the beauty of
His eyes. They are as a brilliant jewel, fitly set in gold. They are full
of tenderness and compassion.&nbsp;

<P>See them as He weeps over His people because of their rejection of Him
(Lk. 19:41). See Him when Lazarus died, weeping, as He sees what sin does
to those He loves (Jn. 11:35). See how piercing they are as He told Peter
how he would deny Him three times before the cock crew twice (Mk. 14:30,
72).

<P>How can we hide ourselves from this kind of sight? We cannot. All things
are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do (Heb.
4:13).

<P>This is comforting to us though, if we know ourselves to be really His
dove. He sees our brokenness in prayer, our confessions of sin, our groans
and sighs, and our desires to know more of Him. Doves mourn, and He says
they shall be comforted (Ezek. 7:16, Matt.5:14).

<P>May we go forth weeping with tenderness and compassion on all that are
lost, bearing the precious seed of the gospel; for if we sow in tears,
we shall surely reap in joy (Psa 126:5-6). Our weeping may endure for a
night - - a long night – but our joy will come in the morning (Psa. 30:5).
Our God will wipe away all our tears one day (Rev. 7:17). But while we
are waiting, let us remember that He is keeping all our tears in His bottle
(Psa. 56:8). This was the practice of loved ones that died many years ago
in the East. The remaining person would bury the bottle of tears with the
loved one, as a token of how much he, or she, was loved. Our tears are
not wasted. They are very precious to Him. "Blessed are you that weep now"
(Lk. 6:21).

<P>May we be as our Lord, and the Psalmist that said, "Rivers of waters
run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law" (Psa. 119:136). Then
the words of the Lord shall be true of us. "Behold, thou art fair, my love;
thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes."</TD>
