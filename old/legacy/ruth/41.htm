<P>Oh, how sweet is the fragrance of the Lord!&nbsp; It is so sweet that
Solomon writes that it causes the virgins to love Him (S.O.S. 1:3).&nbsp;

<P>Did you know that the world's supply of attar of roses comes from the
Balkan Mountains?&nbsp; These roses must be gathered in the darkest hours
of the night. The pickers begin at one o'clock and finish picking them
at two.&nbsp; They do this because actual scientific tests have proven
that forty percent of the fragrance disappeared in the light of day.&nbsp;

<P>Our Lord is the Rose of Sharon (S.O.S. 2:1).&nbsp; Is it any wonder
then, that as the greatest beauty and sweetness of His life was seen, it
had to be cut off from its earthly root to spread its fragrance throughout
all the world?&nbsp; Wicked men picked this "Rose" in the greatest darkness
that this world will ever know.&nbsp; But because they did, and God purposed
it to be so in mercy for us (Acts 2:23), His fragrance has sweetened the
lives of millions of people throughout the ages of time (II Cor. 2:15).&nbsp;

<P>Dear Christian, are you in a dark place, a night of sorrow right now?&nbsp;
Look for this "Rose" and do as Solomon's bride did.&nbsp; She put a little
of this perfume in a box and hung it around her neck to sweeten her sleep
(S.O.S.).&nbsp; Do the same.&nbsp; Hold this "Rose" close to you in your
"night" and smell His sweetness.&nbsp; You will find it to be a fragrance
so precious, so exhilarating, so empowering, that you will never want to
be without it (S.O.S. 3:6).&nbsp;

<P>The Lord says, "As He is, so are we in this world" (I Jn. 4:17).&nbsp;
Let us, daily, offer up to God our sweet savor offerings even though they
must be made by fire (Lev. 1:9).&nbsp; But remember, they must be made
of the inward parts and legs - they must be made with the heart, walking
in love as Christ has loved us (Eph. 5:2).&nbsp; Then they shall be unto
God a sweet savor of Christ, a savor of life unto life, even though they
shall be to those that perish a savor of death unto death, as we manifest
the knowledge of Christ in every place (II Cor. 2:14-16).&nbsp;

<P>May God help us to do it.&nbsp;</TD>
