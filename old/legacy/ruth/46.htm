<P>Oh, to be satisfied with "just" the presence of God with us. I say "just"
and am ashamed to write this word as "just" suggests being deprived of
something, and what can we be deprived of if God is all, and the fountain
of all, and being His child, all things are ours (I Cor. 3:21). Yet there
seems to be some of us that are still not weaned though we have been Christians
for many years.&nbsp;

<P>Oh, that we could be like David who said, "Surely I have behaved and
quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even
as a weaned child." He was content to know that his "mother" was always
there with him in the same house, but out of sight for long periods of
time. Now he had learned to eat "solid food" and that satisfied his soul.&nbsp;

<P>Oh, how we need to be, and this evil world needs to see, adult children
of God that are satisfied, and content to do without; without things, without
friends, without loved ones, and still be content – satisfied with God,
alone. He is always there to comfort us (Isa. 66:13). We may not feel His
closeness; we may not have a felt sense of His love; nevertheless He is
eternally, unchangeably, JEHOVAH SHAMMAH – THE LORD – THERE (Ezek. 48:35).&nbsp;

<P>May more of us come to be "His weaned child," showing this world that
is so dissatisfied with life, that His presence with us, felt or not, is
enough for us because we can depend on His word and His promises, and have
experienced and known His love for us.&nbsp;

<P>We will heartily seek to do this when our hearts are breaking as we
see so many lost people, especially children, alone, their needs not met,
without a father or mother to care for them, and show them that there is
a heavenly Father that promises to supply His children abundantly with
food, clothing, and all needed things so that they shall not only be "calm
and quiet as a weaned child," but will be so satisfied, so content, that
they shall shout for joy (Psa. 132:15-16).

<P>May the Lord make all of us HIS WEANED CHILDREN.</TD>
