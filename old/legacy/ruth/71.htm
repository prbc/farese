<P>A hand is a symbol of skill, energy, action, and control.  Hands are those things with which we do our work, and the Lord gives us an understanding of His work by the words that He has given to men who wrote them down in the bible.
<p>
In Psalm 138:7 we read, "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will save me." Here is a verse that is full of encouragement and comfort.
<p>
When we walk in trouble - trouble that tends to deaden our souls toward God - the Lord will revive us.  He will stretch out His hand against our enemies.  Think what that means.  
<p>
To stretch is to make larger.  How much larger can the hand of an infinite God be made?  He is telling us that no matter how many enemies there are; no matter how widely they have scattered themselves throughout the world; wherever we are - wherever we go - His hand will reach our enemies and save us from them; His right hand will do it.  
<p>
His right hand is a place of honor.  His sheep will be there, and their Advocate with them, to defend their cause effectually (Psa. 16:8, Matt. 25:33).  No wonder David wasn't moved.  If God is for us, who can be against us?  The Lord is always at the right hand of God making intercession for us (Rom. 8:31-34).
<p>
His right hand is a place of omnipotence - His eternal purpose and power (Acts 4:28, 30).  But it speaks of much more; it speaks of His eternal love.  His left hand is under our head, and His right hand embraces us (S.O.S. 2:6).  He keeps us from "sinking in despair," so to speak, as He holds us close to Him.  His love for us is so powerful that nothing can quench it, or overcome it (S.O.S. 8:6-7).
<p>
His right hand is a place of fullness of joy.  We will stand one day beside Him as His queen, His bride, dressed in the finest gold.  We will be not only glorious without, but glorious within, because He has woven our dress with His gold (Psa. 45:9, 13).
<p>
He has stretched out His hand to us not only to destroy our enemies, but to assure us of His faithfulness, His friendship, and His love.  He has given us His hand; the pledge of His heart, and no one can snatch us out of His hand (II Kgs. 10:15, Jn. 10:28-29).  What greater strength, what greater comfort is there???
<p>
"Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.  For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand" (Psa. 95:6-7).<p>
