<center><b><font size=+1>HIS REAPING</font></b>
<br><b><i>by R. T. Holmes</i></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let both grow together until the harvest:
and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together
first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the
wheat into my barn" (Matt. 13:30).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end has come; the seed has been planted;
it has grown to maturity; it is time to reap the harvest and gather the
wheat into the barn.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and
upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.&nbsp; And another angel came out
of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust
in thy sickle, and reap; for the time is come for thee to reap; for the
harvest of the earth is ripe" (Rev. 14:14-15).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a time coming when our Master Gardener
will want to harvest the crop that He has planted.&nbsp; There are many
plants that look very much alike and it is very hard to tell them apart;
it requires an all-seeing, and all knowing person; such is our Master Gardener.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been some tares growing in His garden and He has left them until
He comes.&nbsp; They are not His seed, but the seed of the devil.&nbsp;
They shall be burned in the fire (Matt. 13:37-40).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear reader, I plead with you as you come to
the end of these writings on "The Master Gardener and His Garden" to listen
to the warnings of your Gardener.&nbsp; He says that if you are His seed,
planted in good ground, you will hear His words, and understand them, and
because you do, you will bear fruit - His fruit (Matt. 13:23).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four types of fruit that Christians
bear, but we all must bear the first type if we want to believe that we
have really become Christians according to God's word.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first type is called "the firstfruits of
the Spirit" (Rom. 8:23).&nbsp; It is what God gives and produces in us
when we first come out of darkness into His light (Eph. 5:8).&nbsp; He
gives repentance (Acts 11:18), faith (Rom. 12:3, Eph. 2:8), hope, (Rom.
15:13, Col. 1:27), peace, joy, and love (Rom. 5:1-5).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is the fruit of the Spirit - love,
joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and self-control
(Gal. 5:22-23).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third is the fruit of the lips - praising
and thanking God continually, in all things and for all things with joy
in our hearts (Heb. 13:15, I Th. 5:18, Eph. 5:20).&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth is the fruit of the righteous.&nbsp;
"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls
is wise" (Prov. 11:30).&nbsp; God's plants produce others in His time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this fruit begins growing and forming from
the first day that one hears and believes the truth of the gospel (Col.
1:3-6).&nbsp; Please don't settle for anything less; by our fruits we are
known (Matt. 7:20).&nbsp; It is the evidence of life or death (Jn. 15:1-8).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God bless His seed and cause it to grow
in your soul so that you may be found to be "His garden, enclosed" for
His glory on the last day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
