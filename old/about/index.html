              John Farese was born in 1956 to a Roman Catholic family in Boston.
              He was one of three children in his family to be born with spinal
              muscular atrophy. In his teen years, a jarring move to Florida and
              visits from a Christian aquaintance gave rise to spiritual
              thoughts, even leading to praying the sinner's prayer. However,
              this wasn't accompanied by a God-given change of heart. After bad
              influence from new friends, Johnny involved himself in a life of
              gambling, sex, and drug abuse. &nbsp;
              <br />
              <br />His brother gave him a Bible, which Johnny promised to read.
              God began to work by his conscience, and he no longer felt
              comfortable with his sinning. After many months, Johnny started
              reading the Bible and was convicted of his sins and his need to
              repent and trust in Christ as his Saviour. He joined a local
              church, being zealous to serve, though he at this time was
              bedridden. God used him to be an help and encouragement to
              thousands, both those he was a counselor to at Emmanuel Reformed
              Baptist Church, and the ones he came in contact with over the
              internet. He taught himself web design and coded many sites for
              churches and friends, one of which is a personal site which
              included a directory of Reformed Baptist churches. He went to be
              with his Lord in March of 2014.

              <br />"I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I
              can do something. And because I cannot do everything, I will not
              refuse to do the something that I can do. What I can do, I should
              do. And what I should do, by the grace of God, I will do."
