<td><b><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Strongest
Dad in the World</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>From Sports
Illustrated, By Rick Reilly</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>I try to be
a good father. Give my kids mulligans. Work nights to pay for their text
messaging. Take them to swimsuit shoots. But compared with Dick Hoyt, I
stink.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Eighty-five
times he's pushed his disabled son, Rick, 26.2 miles in marathons. Eight
times he's not only pushed him 26.2 miles in a wheelchair but also towed
him 2.4 miles in a dinghy while swimming and pedaled him 112 miles in a
seat on the handlebars--all in the same day.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Dick's also
pulled him cross-country skiing, taken him on hi s back mountain climbing
and once hauled him across the U.S . on a bike. Makes taking your son bowling
look a little lame, right?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>And what has
Rick done for his father? Not much--except save his life.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>This love story
began in Winchester, Mass., 43 years ago, when Rick was strangled by the
umbilical cord during birth, leaving him brain-damaged and unable to control
his limbs. ``He'll be a vegetable the rest of his life;'' Dick says doctors
told him and his wife, Judy, when Rick was nine months old. ``Put him in
an institution.''</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>But the Hoyts
weren't buying it. They noticed the way Rick's eyes followed them around
the room. When Rick was 11 they took him to the engineering department
at Tufts University and asked if there was anything to help the boy communicate.
``No way,'' Dick says he was told. ``There's nothing going on in his brain.''</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>"Tell him a
joke,'' Dick countered. They did. Rick laughed. Turns out a lot was going
on in his brain.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Rigged up with
a computer that allowed him to control the cursor by touching a switch
with the side of his head, Rick was finally able to communicate. First
words? ``Go Bruins!'' And after a high school classmate was paralyzed in
an accident and the school organized a charity run for him, Rick pecked
out, ``Dad, I want to do that.''</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Yeah, right.
How was Dick, a self-described ``porker'' who never ran more than a mile
at a time, going to push his son five miles? Still, he tried. ``Then it
was me who was handicapped,'' Dick says. ``I was sore for two weeks.''</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>That day changed
Rick's life. ``Dad,'' h e typed, ``when we were running, it felt like I
wasn't disabled anymore!''&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>And that sentence
changed Dick's life. He became obsessed with giving Rick that feeling as
often as he could. He got into such hard-belly shape that he and Rick were
ready to try the 1979 Boston Marathon.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>``No way,''
Dick was told by a race official. The Hoyts weren't quite a single runner,
and they weren't quite a wheelchair competitor. For a few years Dick and
Rick just joined the massive field and ran anyway, then they found a way
to get into the race officially: In 1983 they ran another marathon so fast
they made the qualifying time for Boston the following year.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Then somebody
said, ``Hey, Dick, why not a triathlon?''&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>How's a guy
who never learned to swim and hadn't ridden a bike since he was six going
to haul his 110-pound kid through a triathlon? Still, Dick tried.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Now they've
done 212 triathlons, including four grueling 15-hour Ironmans in Hawaii.
It must be a buzzkill to be a 25-year-old stud getting passed by an old
guy towing a grown man in a dinghy, don't you think?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Hey, Dick,
why not see how you'd do on your own? ``No way,'' he says. Dick does it
purely for ``the awesome feeling'' he gets seeing Rick with a cantaloupe
smile as they run, swim and ride together.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>This year,
at ages 65 and 43, Dick and Rick finished their 24th Boston Marathon, in
5,083rd place out of m o re than 20,000 starters. Their best time'? Two
hours, 40 minutes in 1992--only 35 minutes off the world record, which,
in case you don't keep track of these things, happens to be held by a guy
who was not pushing another man in a wheelchair at the time.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>``No question
about it,'' Rick types. ``My dad is the Father of the Century.''&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>And Dick got
something else out of all this too. Two years ago he had a mild heart attack
during a race. Doctors found that one of his arteries was 95% clogged.
``If you hadn't been in such great shape,'' one doctor told him, ``you
probably would've died 15 years ago.''&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>So, in a way,
Dick and Rick saved e ac h other's life.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>Rick, who has
his own apartment (he gets home care) and works in Boston, and Dick, retired
from the military and living in Holland, Mass., always find ways to be
together. They give speeches around the country and compete in some backbreaking
race every > weekend, including this Father's Day.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>That night,
Rick will buy his dad dinner, but the thing he really wants to give him
is a gift he can never buy.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>``The thing
I'd most like,'' Rick types, ``is that my dad would sit in the chair and
I would push him once.'</font></font></font></td>
