          <p class="text-dark">John Farese was born in 1956 to a Roman Catholic family in Boston. He was one of three
            children in his family to be born with spinal muscular atrophy. In his teen years, a jarring move to Florida
            and visits from a Christian aquaintance gave rise to spiritual thoughts, even leading to praying the
            sinner's prayer. However, this wasn't accompanied by a God-given change of heart. After bad influence from
            new friends, Johnny involved himself in a life of gambling, sex, and drug abuse.
            &nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>His brother gave him a Bible, which Johnny promised to read. God began to work by his conscience, and he
            no longer felt comfortable with his sinning. After many months, Johnny started reading the Bible and was
            convicted of his sins and his need to repent and trust in Christ as his Saviour. He joined a local church,
            being zealous to serve, though he at this time was bedridden. God used him to be an help and encouragement
            to thousands, both those he was a counselor to at Emmanuel Reformed Baptist Church, and the ones he came in
            contact with over the internet. He taught himself web design and coded many sites for churches and friends,
            one of which is a personal site which included a directory of Reformed Baptist churches. He went to be with
            his Lord in March of 2014.
            <br>
            <br>"I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And because I cannot do
            everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do. What I can do, I should do. And what I
            should do, by the grace of God, I will do."
