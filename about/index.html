          <p class="lead text-dark">John Farese was born in 1956 to a Roman Catholic family in Boston. He was one of three children in his family to be born with spinal muscular atrophy. In his teen years, a jarring move to Florida and visits from a Christian aquaintance gave
            rise to spiritual thoughts, even leading to praying the sinner's prayer. However, this wasn't accompanied by a God-given change of heart. After bad influence from new friends, Johnny involved himself in a life of gambling, sex, and drug abuse.
            &nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>His brother gave him a Bible, which Johnny promised to read. God began to work by his conscience, and he no longer felt comfortable with his sinning. After many months, Johnny started reading the Bible and was convicted of his sins and his
            need to repent and trust in Christ as his Saviour. He joined a local church, being zealous to serve, though he at this time was bedridden. God used him to be an help and encouragement to thousands, both those he was a counselor to at Emmanuel
            Reformed Baptist Church, and the ones he came in contact with over the internet. He taught himself web design and coded many sites for churches and friends, one of which is a personal site which included a directory of Reformed Baptist churches.
            He went to be with his Lord in 2013.
