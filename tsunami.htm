people are asking questions like "What does the tsunami mean? Is this a
sign from God? Is God angry with men? Is God punishing people because of
their sin?" In order to interpret the tsunami and similar catastrophes
(indeed to interpret all life and experience), we must view the event from
the vantage point of a Biblical worldview. A Biblical worldview rests upon
the three pillars of Biblical reality: Creation, the Fall, and Redemption.
The tsunami must be interpreted in relation to these three foundational
truths&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>THE TSUNAMI MUST BE VIEWED IN THE
LIGHT OF CREATION&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The world which God created was created
very good (Genesis 1:31). It was a world without sin, without sorrow, without
death. God made man, male and female, in His image and gave him responsibility
for creation. God commanded man to be obedient to Him and warned that disobedience
would bring death into the world. The state of creation depended upon the
man’s obedience to God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>A world in which earthquakes and
tsunamis occur is not the world that God originally made. We see a world
filled with natural disasters and death, but that is not the original order
of things. Originally God created a very good world. Originally, man lived
in perfect communion with God. Originally all creation was unified with
its components functioning in symbiotic balance. There was no death, no
violent natural upheavals by a world out of balance, a world convulsing
harmfully against itself. For God saw all that He had made, and behold,
it was very good. (Genesis 1:31)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>THE TSUNAMI MUST BE VIEWED IN THE
LIGHT OF THE FALL&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>At the center of the Fall is the
disobedience of man. Enticed by a fallen angel named Satan, our first parents
rebelled against God, disobeyed His command and came under the judgment
of God which brought death into the world. Through one man (Adam) sin entered
into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because
all sinned (Romans 5:12). Adam’s original sin brought death upon everyone
and everything for which he was responsible to God. Consequently all his
children (mankind) are born in a state of legal and actual death. Death,
according to Scripture, is a separation, a division of those things that
God originally made as a unified whole. Death is especially the state of
being separated from God. At birth, all men are estranged from God, inheriting
Adam’s legal standing of guilt and are naturally oriented to disobey God.
Rather than living in loving knowledge of God, fallen men are now ignorant
of God. Rather than worshipping the true God, men are deceived by the god
of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4) Satan, who, because of Adam’s rebellion,
has usurped the place of God in the world.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The earth itself was also affected
as a consequence of Adam’s sin. Death enveloped creation. The components
of the perfectly balanced creation became separated, disjointed, and imbalanced.
The earth was cursed and man’s body would return to the dust in physical
death (Genesis 3:17-19). The world that previously sustained life would
continue to do so, but as a cursed earth. Fallen man is consigned to live
in a cursed earth in which both he and the world are visited by death.
The state of the earth continues to be integrally bound up with the state
of man’s relationship to God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>However, creation has not been abandoned
by God to death. God immediately came to this fallen world and rescued
it in grace. But before we consider God’s grace, we need to give full weight
to these first two foundational aspects of a Biblical worldview. We need
to understand the full integrity of Creation and the Fall. This is a good
world that has been brought by man’s sin, into a bad state. When we experience
death and the tragedies of things like tsunamis, we are experiencing the
repercussions of the Fall. We are experiencing life in a world enveloped
by death, a world essentially separated from God, a world in need of deliverance
– for we are a people in need of deliverance.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>THE TSUNAMI MUST BE VIEWED IN THE
LIGHT OF REDEMPTION&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We must appreciate that legally,
as our Creator-Judge, God would have been completely righteous had He visited
the disobedient couple with Final Judgment. No wrong would have been done
had the Lord come into the Garden, lined the three culprits up (Adam, Eve,
and the Serpent) and then and there pronounced the sentence of eternal
separation from God; then and there transformed the earth into hell – a
place of unmitigated punishment and wrath. Had God done that, none of us
could protest of an injustice.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>But God came to the fallen couple
and this death-enveloped world in grace. Death indeed had come. Death saturated
every aspect of man’s experience. He experienced separation in his relation
to God, to himself, to others, and to the created world. But into this
sad situation, God came in grace. In Genesis 3 we read of how He salvaged
the then disintegrating cosmos. He put enmity between humanity and Satan.
He secured both the woman and the man in their respective original functions
so as to sustain the order of life on earth. In grace He rescued His creation
so that it will eventually share in His full and eternal deliverance. God’s
plan of deliverance was announced to Satan in the hearing of the couple.
He would send One who would defeat Satan and in so doing, rescue fallen
man and creation itself from death, from eternal separation from God.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>As God’s purposes of grace are worked
out through history, God continues to sustain this fallen world. This is
the world in which we live. It is a fallen world in which God's grace is
demonstrated. Jesus tells us that the Father causes His sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous
(Matthew 5:45b) and that the Father Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil
men (Luke 6:35b). Paul tells us that God did not leave Himself without
witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful
seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness. (Acts 14:17). What
would this fallen world be were it not for the grace of God?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We are shocked and dismayed at the
upheavals of natural disasters that disrupt our sense of well-being and
visit destruction upon us. But in a fallen world, the amazing thing is
that sinful men are given rain and sunshine and know satisfaction of heart!
I know that sounds jarring, but that is because we rarely see ourselves
from God’s viewpoint. We do not realize just how sinful we are and how
gracious He is. When we have sunshine and rain and fruitful seasons, we
are not getting what we deserve from God. We are receiving His kindness.
We live and move and have our being in Him (Acts 17:28) and He, astonishingly,
is kind to us ungrateful and evil men.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Sadly, most men do not understand
that this world was created as very good but fell through man’s sin into
death. Nor do most realize that this fallen world is now being sustained
by God's grace. In many people’s thinking, their view of origins (Creation)
merges with their view of sin and evil (the Fall). By not distinguishing
these two foundational truths, they view the world as being inherently
defective. They assume that death (evil) is simply the "natural order"
of things. Most men do not understand that death is foreign to God’s original
creation. By mixing their view of origins with their view of evil, many
wrongly blame God for evil. A tsunami hits and men question and blame God.
"If God is good and powerful, why is there suffering and death?" The question
assumes this common confluence of Creation and the Fall. The questioner
posits the goodness of God, but fails to factor in the Fall. The good God
created a good world, but sinful man brought death into the world and it
is now a fallen world in need of deliverance. The good God is our Deliverer!
Satan doers not triumph. Death is not victorious. Man is not lost. Creation
is not destroyed. God’s purposes for redemption are being accomplished.
There is good news for us sinners and for our fallen planet. In grace God
still sustains this created order. In grace He sent His Son Jesus Christ
that the world through Him might be saved (John 3:17). Jesus is the promised
One of Genesis 3:15. Jesus Christ has appeared for this purpose, that He
might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Once we view suffering and death
in the context of Creation and the Fall, we are then able to perceive how
it is that God is at work redemptively in the world. Suffering, for the
Christian, is not meaningless, but is to be viewed in the context of God’s
redemptive purpose for this fallen world. The apostle Paul writes: For
I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the anxious longing
of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For
the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because
of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be
set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of
the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers
the pains of childbirth together until now. And not only this, but also
we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption
of our body (Rom 8:18-23). Paul is referring to the Fall when he explains
that this present world has been subjected to futility and corruption and
now groans like a woman about to give birth: the whole creation groans
and suffers the pains of childbirth. The fallen world awaits its deliverance,
when it will be set free from its slavery to corruption. Until that time
the world, like a woman in labor, experiences protracted periods of discomfort
with episodes of intense explosions of pain. The tsunami was an explosion
of pain. This is the best metaphor by which to understand life in this
present fallen but grace-sustained world: the metaphor of a woman experiencing
the contractions of giving birth. The contractions, although painful, are
part of a process that issues into the joy of a new life. This world writhes
and groans in a birthing process that will issue into a new cosmos and
the revelation of the sons of God in the Resurrection. We who are in Christ,
although we also groan, we yet live in hope.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>THE TSUNAMI MUST BE VIEWED IN THE
LIGHT OF FINAL JUDGMENT&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>History, according to the Bible,
is linear: it has a beginning and an end and moves like a straight line.
History is not a revolving circle, an endless repetition whose beginning
and ultimate purpose is unknown. History began at Creation and is moving
to Final Judgment. As the line of history progresses, the world will experience
more frequent and more intense "eschatological contractions." These birth
pangs are painful precursors to the final contraction that will occur at
the Second Coming of Christ, "The Day of the Lord", or Final Judgment.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>The final contraction is described
by Peter in 2 Peter 3:3-13. Know this first of all, that in the last days
mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts,
and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers
fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation."
For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of
God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water
and by water, through which the world at that time was destroyed, being
flooded with water. But the present heavens and earth by His word are being
reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly
men. But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with
the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is
patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to
repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up. Since all
these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought
you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the
coming of the day of God, on account of which the heavens will be destroyed
by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat! But according
to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which
righteousness dwells. This created order will be destroyed in a global
cataclysm similar to Noah's Flood, except that the element of destruction
will not be water, but fire. This final contraction will issue into the
formation of new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
The final contraction will involve a convulsion of the entire globe. Preliminary
contractions leading up to the end will be similar in kind but less intense
and will be regional rather than global. The world will increasingly convulse
eschatological contractions, "signs of the times", indicators that history
is moving to Final Judgment.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Jesus informed us of the signs in
"The Olivet Discourse" recorded in Matthew 24 and 25 as well as Luke 21.
One sign is the global expansion of His Kingdom through the preaching of
the gospel and the building of His church. Today virtually every people
group on earth has received testimony of the gospel. Another sign is the
opposition and persecution that His people encounter as the Kingdom of
light invades Satan’s kingdom of darkness. The twentieth century has witnessed
more persecution of Christians and all the previous centuries combined.
Another sign is the increase of apostasy accompanied by the rise of false
religions. Today many so-called "Christian" churches have abandoned the
gospel and compromise Scriptural doctrine, practice, and morals. A fourth
sign concerns our present interest: the sign evidencing the birth pangs
of this created order. Wars, earthquakes, famines, pestilence - these catastrophes
are signs, eschatological contractions leading up to the birth of a new
world which will be revealed in conjunction with the Final Judgment of
mankind.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>In teaching about the end of the
world, Jesus employs the metaphor of a woman in childbirth. And you will
be hearing of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not frightened,
for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. For nation
will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places
there will be famines and earthquakes. But all these things are merely
the beginning of birth pangs (Matthew 24:6-8). These eschatological birth
pangs are referred to in Luke. And there will be signs in sun and moon
and stars, and upon the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the
roaring of the sea and the waves, men fainting from fear and the expectation
of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens
will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory. But when these things begin to take place,
straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing
near (Luke 21:25-28). Certainly a 9.0 earthquake qualifies as a great earthquake.
Scientists tell us that the December 26th earthquake actually shifted the
earth's axis - for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Certainly
the tsunami that surged onto nine nations around and beyond the Indian
Ocean qualifies as the roaring of the sea and the waves. And consequently
men all over the world are in perplexity, fainting from fear and the expectation
of the things which are coming upon the world. In light of Jesus' teachings,
I submit to you that we should view the tsunami as a birth pang, an eschatological
contraction, a sign of divine judgment.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>However I must hasten to qualify
how the tsunami signifies divine judgment. Note that Jesus says that is
not yet the end, all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.
As when a woman in labor has a contraction, we know that the birth will
occur, but a contraction is just preparatory. As a contraction, the tsunami
points to the certain coming of Jesus and Final Judgment. Similar signs
have been given throughout history. The world has seen other horrific catastrophes
and will continue to do so until the end of history. We are to expect that
they will increase in frequency and in number as the time draws near, just
like a woman giving birth.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>There is another qualification that
needs to be made. Those who are suffering in this present catastrophe are
not worse sinners than all others and are not being visited by a specific
judgment of God because of specific sin. In Jesus' day, violence and tragedy
were headline news too. There were some present who reported to Him about
the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And
He answered and said to them, "Do you suppose that these Galileans were
greater sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered this fate?
I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or
do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and
killed them, were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem?
I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." The
unexpected violent and tragic deaths of men was an occasion for Jesus to
inform those yet living that they who died did not die because they were
greater sinners than the living, but that we all face the same prospect
of death and therefore, we need to prepare to die. How? Repent and believe
in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>As fallen sinners, we all stand under
the sentence of God's judgment and are all liable to death. Was the Asian
tsunami divine judgment for sin? Yes, but as an expression of the judgment
under which the entire world exists as a result of the Fall. The tsunami
is no more a judgment than similar devastation elsewhere in this fallen
world. In recent days, America was struck with four successive hurricanes
that devastated the state of Florida. Last summer unprecedented heat caused
death in France. Thousands have recently died in China, Europe, Haiti and
the Dominican Republic due to devastating floods. If unusual death-causing
weather is a sign of coming judgment, then that sign has not been given
only in Asia. Mankind the world over stands under the sentence of death
because of sin. Our world is as it was in the days of Noah when the Lord
saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually (Genesis 6:5). So
Jesus teaches us - For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the
days of Noah. For as in those days which were before the flood they were
eating and drinking, they were marrying and giving in marriage, until the
day that Noah entered the ark, and they did not understand until the flood
came and took them all away; so shall the coming of the Son of Man be (Matthew
24:37-39).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We must not fail to understand what
the tsunami means. Behold, the Judge is standing right at the door (James
5:9). These signs communicate a message from God: this world (you and I)
will be judged. We are heading toward Final Judgment.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>LEARN ABOUT FINAL JUDGMENT FROM THE
TSUNAMI&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>As Abraham was compelled to view
Sodom after it was overcome in its destruction, we too must gaze upon the
horror of the tsunami and learn wisdom. Let me speak, at this point, especially
to you who are yet outside of Christ, who have yet to trust in Him, you
who are not yet Christians.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Learn that Final Judgment will be
a Day like December 26th when destruction suddenly, overwhelmingly engulfed
an unprepared people. Final Judgment, like the tsunami, will come upon
men unexpectedly and will be inescapably overwhelming. While they are saying,
"Peace and safety!" then destruction will come upon them suddenly like
birth pangs upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape (1 Thessalonians
5:3). The final destruction at the end of the age will be global, like
Noah's Flood. There will be no safe location on earth - for anyone: for
it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth (Luke
21:35). Understand that you will not escape the sudden eruption of God's
Day of Judgment when He comes to purge the world of sin and death. It will
be a Day only hinted at by the preliminary contractions of earthquakes
and tsunamis. It will be a Day of unspeakable wrath. Behold, the day of
the Lord is coming, cruel, with fury and burning anger, to make the land
a desolation; and He will exterminate its sinners from it (Isaiah 13:9).
All who are then still under the sentence of death will be swept away in
the eternal fire of judgment. The most fearful thing conceivable is to
come to the Day of Final Judgment still in your sins and then to enter
an eternal death apart from Christ. And do not fear those who kill the
body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able
to destroy both soul and body in hell (Matthew 10:28).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Learn from the tsunami and flee from
the coming wrath of God. John the Baptist preached as a prophet standing
under the impending Day of the Lord and challenged his generation: You
brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? (Luke 3:7)
He preached in anticipation of the wrath to come. The Word of God comes
to you under the looming shadow of the coming Day of the Lord, the Day
of Judgment. During this present time, God, through His church, is calling
the world to repent and be saved by faith in Christ. He is also giving
the world signs, signaling that the Day will soon be here. The tsunami
is a sign. Do not live in denial of what the tsunami signifies! When a
woman starts labor pains, it is foolish to deny what is transpiring with
her body. Understand that this world has begun its eschatological labor
pains. The Day of Judgment is soon upon us. What would Jesus have you to
do? Unless you repent, you too will perish. In repentance from sin and
by faith in Jesus Christ, you can flee from the wrath to come. By faith
in Jesus Christ, you can find forgiveness for sin and not stand before
God under the sentence of death, but stand before Him in the righteousness
of Jesus. By faith in Jesus Christ, you can find safety in Him who alone
has satisfied the wrath of God on the cross and conquered death in His
resurrection. You can call upon Him today – now. He is ready to save all
who seek Him in repentance and faith. God does not want you to perish in
your sin. "For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares
the Lord God. "Therefore, repent and live." (Ezekiel 18:32) He wants you
to believe in Christ and to be saved!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>LIVE LIKE YOU ARE HEADING TO FINAL
JUDGMENT&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>You, who profess faith in Christ,
listen to what your Lord tells you and live in hope. But when these things
begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your
redemption is drawing near (Luke 21:28). You, dear Christian, have turned
to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and (now you) wait for
His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who delivers
us from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 1:9,10). Your Lord is about
to appear! You only, of all the people on the planet, can live with hope!
Adam through his disobedience plunged this world into death. But Jesus,
the last Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45), through His obedience has conquered
death. In the Resurrection at the end of the age, Jesus will transform
us and this fallen world (see Philippians 3:20,21). Jesus, by His victorious
resurrection, has recovered what fallen Adam had lost. As we groan waiting
eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body (Romans 8:23),
we understand that natural catastrophes like the tsunami, are birth pangs
signaling the coming of a new heavens and new earth in which He shall wipe
away every tear from (our) eyes; and there shall no longer be any death;
there shall no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things
have passed away (Revelation 21:4). We lift up our heads! The return of
our Savior will certainly come! Our redemption is drawing near!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>As your heart fills with this hope,
you will be motivated to live in holiness. Everyone who has this hope fixed
on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (1 John 3:3). The evidence
that we are truly joined to Jesus and that we are not destined for wrath
but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thessalonians
5:9) is holiness of life. Since all these things are to be destroyed in
this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,
looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, on account of which
the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with
intense heat! But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, since
you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless
and blameless (2 Peter 3:11-14).&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>We must live oriented to the coming
Day. The birth pangs have begun! Let us not get distracted by the empty
vanities of this passing age, but in everything we do, let us seek first
His Kingdom and His righteousness (Matthew 6:33). In every legitimate endeavor
of life - in our families, our labors, our use of time and money - in all
things, let us live as those who are serving Christ and awaiting His return.
Again listen to Jesus: Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will
not pass away. Be on guard, that your hearts may not be weighted down with
dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day come
on you suddenly like a trap; for it will come upon all those who dwell
on the face of all the earth. But keep on the alert at all times, praying
in order that you may have strength to escape all these things that are
about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man (Luke 21:33-36).
We cannot live carelessly, with dissipation, wasting our time and resources
without focus or purpose. We cannot live in the pursuit of sensuality and
drunkenness. For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried
out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality,
lusts, drunkenness, carousals, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.
The end of all things is at hand; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober
spirit for the purpose of prayer (1 Peter 4:3,7). We cannot allow our hearts
to become dull, cold and loveless (see Matthew 24:12,13), ensnared by the
worries of life. A life full of the weeds of worry will prove to be thorny
and unfruitful in the Day of final harvest (Luke 8:14). We cannot allow
ourselves to be distracted from the Day that is pressing upon us. We are
called to keep on the alert. How? Praying. This act of devotion to Christ
epitomizes and represents all "the means of grace" to which the Christian
gives himself so as to nurture and strengthen his faith and express his
discipleship to Christ. We must be firmly connected to Christ and His people
and give ourselves to those things that foster our spiritual health. The
strength to escape will be given to those who follow Christ by faith and
live wisely, building their lives in obedience to His words - as the wise
man who built his house upon the rock (Matthew 7:24-27). Live with this
anticipation: soon you will stand before the Son of Man. For we must all
appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed
for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good
or bad (2 Corinthians 5:10). Let us come to that Day to stand before Him
having exercised a fruitful faith, having lived a life in which His grace
was evident by our devotion, our obedience, our holiness, and our love.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>Let us therefore live that life which
abides: the life of faith, hope, and love (1 Corinthians 13:13). Let us
hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised
is faithful; and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and
good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit
of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the
day drawing near (Hebrews 10:23-25). Let us have hearts filled with compassion,
like Jesus, for the distressed and downcast (Mt 9:36). Let us be zealous
for good works (Titus 2:7,14; 3:8,14) and adorn the doctrine of God our
Savior in every respect (Titus 2:10). Let us minister, self-sacrificially,
to the needs of others, to those suffering and disoriented by these horrible
events. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven (Matthew 5:16).
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing
us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously
and godly in the present age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing
of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; who gave Himself
for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for
Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds (Titus
2:11-14). Let us live by faith in Christ, in hope of His coming, and extend
His love and His gospel to as many people as we can.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-2>As we live in these sober times,
men all around us will be gripped with a foreboding sense of fear that
something overwhelmingly terrifying is about to happen: men fainting from
fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world
(Luke 21:26). Sadly, many will fail to recognize the "signs of the times"
and will not respond to the gospel. Revelation 9:20,21 says the rest of
mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works
of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and
of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see
nor hear nor walk; and they did not repent of their murders nor of their
sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts. But remember, during
this time the Lord will build His church (Matthew 16:18) and will gather
all His people to Himself at His return (Matthew 24:31). In the meantime,
today is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2). Today is the day of
grace. The gospel is being proclaimed and sinners are repenting and coming
to Christ! This is an eschatological sign of hope! Let us minister Christ's
gospel of hope to our frightened family and friends. Sanctify Christ as
Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who
asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you (1 Peter 3:15).
Share your hope. Let others know that Jesus has risen. He is the first
fruit of the final resurrection harvest which has already begun. Tell them
that there is a new world coming. Warn them to flee from the wrath to come.
Urge them to repent and trust in Jesus - now! We must work the works of
Him who sent Me, as long as it is day; night is coming, when no man can
work (John 9:4). There is urgency to our appeal. The time is short and
the Day is near. People all around us are dying and face the coming Day
of Judgment and eternal death. Let us warn them. Let us plead with them.
Let us beg them for Christ's sake, to be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians
5:20). Let us do the work of our Master for He will soon return. We do
not know when, but we know that He will. And this do, knowing the time,
that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation
is nearer to us than when we first believed. (Romans 13:11) The last recorded
words of Jesus in the Scripture are found in Revelation 22: 20. Yes, I
am coming quickly. I believe Jesus. Do you? I believe that He is coming
quickly. Do you? I see the signs of His coming. Do you? Yes, I am coming
quickly. I believe Him. Amen. Come Lord Jesus.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
